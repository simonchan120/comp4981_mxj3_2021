- story: Escalating disagreements between mother and wife
  steps:
  - user: My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve
      had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is
      too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy. However, it’s intensified
      lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little
      disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?
  - bot: What you are describing is something psychologists have termed "triangulation"
      which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have
      a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead.
      You have been "triangulated" by your wife and mother.
  - bot: This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have
      you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went
      to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront
      another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For
      example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather
      than go to the boss with your complaint.
  - bot: I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party
      mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's
      what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective
      can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like
      this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that
      love you and that you love.
  - bot: If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage
      the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps
      it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up.
      Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship
      with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are
      stuck in the middle.
  - bot: Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is
      possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two
      most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be
      afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law
      describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to
      dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is
      the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law
      she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you
      and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman
      that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your
      mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel
      that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated.
      This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike.
      I am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. These are
      just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours.
  - bot: Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed
      to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you
      don't agree with them. They will get upset if you don't align yourself with
      them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing
      the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think
      you should. In worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself
      in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother
      which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship.
      Change the dynamics before it spirals even further.

- story: I'm addicted to smoking. How can I stop?
  steps:
  - user: I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes
      it's not a physical need, it's mental. I cannot help myself from thinking about
      smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?
  - bot: Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby
      (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able
      to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.
  - bot: For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological
      cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually
      based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously
      trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having
      a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel,
      etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the
      ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.
  - bot: You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and,
      for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE
      thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would
      have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it
      ("Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now."), but then change the thoughts that typically
      follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever
      it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.
  - bot: I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out
      ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes.
      Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write
      down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it
      will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no
      longer have it.
  - bot: Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!

- story: Keeping secrets from my family
  steps:
  - user: I have secrets in my mind, and I don't know what to do with them. I don't
      want to tell my wife and mom because I don't want to hurt them. But I'm not
      sure how long that I can keep the secret to myself. What should I do? It's becoming
      annoying and making me anxious. Help me out
  - bot: It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now. There
      are several things to consider before you make a decision.
  - bot: '- You mentioned that you don''t want your wife and mom to know because you
      don''t want to hurt them – why would it hurt them?'
  - bot: '- Is it necessary for them to know this information?'
  - bot: '- What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling
      them? (for you and for your wife and mom).'
  - bot: '- Once you have considered these, think of what you would tell your friend
      if they were in your exact situation?'
  - bot: '- Also, if your wife or mom were in your situation right now, what do you
      think they would do themselves?'
  - bot: '- If your wife and mom were in this situation, how would you feel? Would
      you want to know the secrets?'
  - bot: '- How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health?'
  - bot: Once you have looked at the problem from all angles, you will be able to
      better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not.

- story: The Underlying Causes of Being Possessive
  steps:
  - user: I am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships.
      How can I fix my underlying issues?
  - bot: Hi there. It's great you are able to realize there are other issues going
      on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing
      someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. All those fears
      can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people
      so you don't lose them. The thing is, controlling other people only pushes them
      away. Vicious circle, right?
  - bot: What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying
      ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things
      you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. Then rewrite those not-so-positive
      things so they are positive. For example, thinking something like, "I'm too
      pushy", can be rewritten as, "I'm assertive and I go after what I want." It
      can be hard to do since we tend to get "stuck" in our negative ways of thinking
      about ourselves. If you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as
      well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.
  - bot: Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that's not
      an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites
      that are out there. You've already taken the first step, so keep moving forward.

- story: Can I control anxiety without medication?
  steps:
  - user: I had a head injury a few years ago and my mind races all the time. I have
      trouble sleeping and have a lot of anxiety. Every medicine I have been on my
      body rejects; I get sick to my stomach and get blisters in my mouth. How can
      I calm my self down? I'm a wreck.
  - bot: You didn't say what or how many medications you've tried. Certain anxiety
      medications can make you feel nauseous, but I haven't heard of any that cause
      mouth blisters, so there may be some other underlying medical issue there. I
      would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed
      the medication as well as a neurologist if you've suffered a severe head injury.
      There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression
      that there may be others with lesser side effects.
  - bot: But beyond that, have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing
      or meditation? Meditation can be very effective, but it takes practice and you
      don't have to sit cross-legged for hours chanting "Ohm" to meditate. It's about
      focusing on your breath, rather than all the thoughts that are racing through
      your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath, simply refocus (and
      refocus and refocus). Like I said, it takes practice, so don't give up. You
      can find many sites offering different ways to meditate, so look around and
      see what works best for you. Like medication, you just have to find the one
      that works best and that might take some experimentation.
  - bot: I hope this helps and best of luck to you.

- story: How do I break an unhealthy relationship pattern?
  steps:
  - user: I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who
      will actually put effort into it. I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men
      and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control
      me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse
      me and I am at their beck and call. I am not comfortable being alone or doing
      anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just
      to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things
      will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?
  - bot: It is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy
      relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern. You seem to have
      some good insight into the situation.
  - bot: 'The type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood
      issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers, childhood trauma
      and/or abuse or neglect, or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you
      to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self. This is something
      that is going to take some time to work through in therapy. I recommend a book
      titled “Boundaries: Where you end and I begin” by Anne Katherine. Another book
      that might be helpful is “Codependent No More” by Melody Beattie.'
  - bot: In the meantime, until you can work through your personal issues, absolutely
      do not enter into another relationship. Take however long you need to and work
      on becoming a whole, happy, emotionally healthy person on your own. Needing
      another person to define you is problematic. That’s too much to expect from
      any individual.
  - bot: For a relationship to be healthy and happy, both people in the relationship
      first need to be a whole person on their own. That means having a clear sense
      of self, knowing who you are and what you want, knowing how to set healthy boundaries,
      and knowing how to meet your own needs. It is unreasonable to expect your partner
      to meet all of your needs all of the time. There will be times that they won’t
      be able to meet your needs. You have to know how to meet those yourself.
  - bot: When you are working on becoming the best you that you can be, eventually
      the right person will come into your life. Then you can CHOOSE to be with someone
      because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you NEED them to
      complete you.

- story: I have anger issues. I am extremely explosive about the simplest things
  steps:
  - user: I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions
      for managing my anger.
  - bot: I suggest that you work on emotional awareness.
  - bot: Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why.
  - bot: Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the
      way you are feeling and your actions. In other words knowing that your feelings
      dictate what you do.
  - bot: Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly
      identify and express the feelings.
  - bot: Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings
      to others. Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being
      misunderstood.
  - bot: Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions.
      For example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness
      or weakness. Therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities,
      or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to
      feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes
      us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways. If a man never learns
      to say “I am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in
      anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger
      and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man
      feeling alone and misunderstood.
  - bot: You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away, remove yourself from
      the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting
      the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just
      happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you. What is
      the real feeling driving these outbursts? Maybe you can begin to recognize an
      underlying pattern.
  - bot: It might help to keep an anger journal. Write down everything that gets you
      upset. That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you
      off. Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint
      the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience.

- story: I’ve suffered from insomnia and nightmares for about 3 years
  steps:
  - user: It takes me a long time to fall asleep; I’d estimate about two hours. I
      often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and I often wake
      up frightened and unable to breathe. I believe I started losing sleep after
      breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. Also, my father’s business went bankrupt
      and my mother has a chronic condition. I was under a lot of stress, and life
      lost meaning. After improving my life and developing a habit of running and
      exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. However in the past couple
      months, I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning.
      How can I solve this issue?
  - bot: First of all, exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional
      health. That's great that you have added this in your routine. Have you also
      considered altering your diet? Certain foods are linked with poor sleep. For
      example, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode
      well with quality sleep, especially right before bed time. On the other hand,
      warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively
      impact sleep.
  - bot: Additionally, at bed time it's important to keep your room dim, cool and
      without distractions (i.e. TV, IPad, Phone). Stick to a sleep routine and avoid
      any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energy.
  - bot: As far as your nightmares, there could be many causes contributing to them.
      Certain foods (many of the ones mentioned) or medications could be the culprit.
      Doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate
      the offender.
  - bot: You may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss
      any underlying issues you are experiencing. Oftentimes, depression and anxiety
      can manifest themselves during sleep, causing nightmares.
  - bot: Finally, Yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep. There are
      many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if
      you'd rather not join a class right away.
  - bot: Best of luck to you and I sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some
      well deserved Z's!

- story: Unethical Therapy Practices
  steps:
  - user: What do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up
      lies in order to stop the other parent's custody visitation?
  - bot: I will admit I am confused about this question. Are you the other parent
      in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist?
  - bot: Therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication. Most therapists
      won't even get involved in a custody battle. They know there is a good chance
      of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify
      in court. Of course, therapists are human and can make mistakes, but I find
      it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something
      like this that is such a major ethical violation. Not only are they losing their
      license to practice by doing this, they are going to face criminal charges and
      jail time. If their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to
      the child, they don't have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this.
  - bot: If you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process
      in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board.
      Every therapist is licensed in their state. There are different types of licensures
      so you would need to know this therapist's licensure.
  - bot: Most accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation
      because people do tend to get quite ugly. Don't accuse the therapist or the
      parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad.
      Have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this. If this has really
      happened then of course it needs to be reported, but don't try to ruin someone's
      career unless you are sure this occurred.

- story: My friends accusing me of having problems
  steps:
  - user: They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in
      the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?
  - bot: It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you
      a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key
      to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face
      to address why they feel your behavior is concerning.
  - bot: In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering
      texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them
      and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it
      is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons
      for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior
      accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make
      sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and
      name calling is not one of them.
  - bot: On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it
      may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships
      are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people
      who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.
  - bot: I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!

- story: About a year ago I found out my husband had cheated on me.
  steps:
  - user: Cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters
      I decided not to break up the family. However, now I am struggling to forget
      and forgive what happened. I feel like I cannot trust him. Without trust, I
      cannot stay in this relationship. On the other hand, I do not want my children
      to get hurt. I'm not sure how to move forward?
  - bot: First of all, my heart goes out to you. Infidelity is an extremely challenging
      obstacle to overcome. There are some things that you should consider. First
      of all, did he seem truly remorseful? If you felt in his heart that he was truly
      sorry for what he had done, it will give you a piece of mind that it was a mistake.
  - bot: Secondly, was he forthcoming with this information? How about with answering
      your questions after the truth was uncovered? If you found that he was still
      lying or not forthcoming, the sting is even more painful. He should be able
      to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitation.
  - bot: Thirdly, has he shown a positive difference after this experience? At this
      time, he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage, you and the
      children.
  - bot: Keep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief. It is not a
      quick process that can easily be overcome. What you are experiencing is 100%
      normal.
  - bot: My best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist. Find out what drove
      your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life
      has been resolved. I know its important for you to keep your family together
      but children can sense anger and frustration, this is not a healthy environment
      either. If you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship, a therapist
      will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing
      your children's needs.
  - bot: Please know that you are not alone and that unfortunately, many relationships
      have endured this very thing. It may also be helpful to reach out to people
      who have experienced similar obstacles. The web is a great resource to find
      groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding board.

- story: Sleeping, Anger and Anxiety
  steps:
  - user: I have a lot of issues going on right now. First of all, I have a lot of
      trouble sleeping at times, while other nights I sleep too much and still feel
      quite tired. I’m also noticing increased irritability and experiencing anxiety
      attacks that last for hours. Is there something wrong with me and if so what
      should I do?
  - bot: It sounds as if you may be experiencing a bout of anxiety and/or depression.
      Sleeping difficulties, irritability and anxiety attacks all are correlated with
      these mood disorders. And it’s actually quite common for someone to deal encounter
      this during their lifetime.
  - bot: Also, keep in mind that just because you are experiencing this now does not
      mean that you will be dealing with it the rest of your life. Many times, it
      can be a single episode and if treatment is received, you can help prevent any
      recurrent episodes.
  - bot: However, you may want to first talk with your primary physician to rule out
      any medical issues that could be causing these problems. There may be a reason
      for the sudden onset of these symptoms that can be addressed quickly.
  - bot: 'On the other hand, if it is determined that you are experiencing anxiety
      and/or depression without a medical reason, there are two methods that are very
      helpful in your treatment:'
  - bot: '#1 Talk therapy with a certified therapist'
  - bot: He/She will be able to address the concerns you’re experiencing and discovering
      if there is an underlying issue that may be causing it.
  - bot: '#2 Medication'
  - bot: There are many medications that can assist you with the feelings that you
      are experiencing. Your doctor will be able to help you find the right one that
      works for you. If one doesn’t work, keep trying. There are many different options
      to address your specific needs.
  - bot: Also, a combination of these two options is extremely beneficial!

- story: I'm losing my husband because my lack of sex drive
  steps:
  - user: I have no sex drive due to medical issues. I’ve shut down completely and
      closed everyone out. I’ve even told my husband that I wanted a divorce since
      that’s what I thought he wanted to hear. However, it devastated me when I learned
      he's seeing someone else. I’ve since told him that I wanted to work things out
      but he’s not sure I actually mean it. He thinks the only reason I want him back
      is because I’m jealous. How do I show him I’m serious?
  - bot: I’m sorry to hear about your current situation. My heart goes out to you
      during this time.
  - bot: First of all, it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with
      your doctor. Regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with
      your husband, you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing.
      More than likely he/she will be able to help you relieve some of these symptoms.
  - bot: Secondly, you must be upfront and honest with your husband. Intimacy is a
      large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not
      disclose how you were feeling. I think he would appreciate knowing that it was
      your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason
      being him.
  - bot: If you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your
      doctor in order to enhance your relationship, he may be more willing to see
      that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship.
  - bot: The conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband
      since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial. And
      please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing (or lack
      thereof), was not your fault.
  - bot: Best of luck to you and your husband!

- story: Sleeping, Anger and Anxiety
  steps:
  - user: I have a lot of issues going on right now. First of all, I have a lot of
      trouble sleeping at times, while other nights I sleep too much and still feel
      quite tired. I’m also noticing increased irritability and experiencing anxiety
      attacks that last for hours. Is there something wrong with me and if so what
      should I do?
  - bot: Hi there. I have to commend you on reaching out to get some answers on why
      you are feeling the way that you are feeling. A lot of people secretly go about
      their lives every day feeling this way because they are too afraid of what the
      answer might be.
  - bot: First off, what stressors do you have in your life right now? Financial,
      relationship and unemployment are all common stressors for people. They can
      often make it difficult for us to sleep at night due to the constant racing
      thoughts and wonders of how you will deal with it all.
  - bot: Secondly, do you have a history of depression or does depression run in your
      family? Some of the symptoms listed here in this question (i.e. trouble sleeping,
      constant fatigue, too much sleep, anger & anxiety) are all common symptoms of
      depression. Often times, these symptoms can be overlooked and mistaken for "just
      being tired."
  - bot: Furthermore, it's important to ask yourself, if you are feeling worthless,
      problems with concentration and recurrent thoughts of death. If you are having
      these symptoms, please seek help IMMEDIATELY.
  - bot: Lastly, considering your stated symptoms I would recommend reaching out to
      your Doctor for further consult. It's always better to be safe and the earlier
      you catch the symptoms the faster you will get to feeling better! do Some helpful
      tips for the your Doctor would be to monitor your sleep habits (i.e. how much
      or little are you sleeping), make a list of your triggers for your anger outbursts
      as well as your triggers for your anxiety attacks.
  - bot: I hope this was helpful and the best of luck to you.

- story: My parents are threatening to get rid of the only things I still care about
  steps:
  - user: The last of my emotions belong to my pets. Today my dad said he might get
      rid of them tomorrow. If that does happen I might dig hole in the ground with
      a paper that says "here lays my emotions. R.I.P." I practically have no emotions
      left and I came to the realization about this not being normal by comparing
      my reaction to certain situations to my family's. What's wrong with me?
  - bot: It sounds to me like you have had a lot going on and now you are afraid you
      are going to lose the last things you care about, your pets. I do not know what
      all is going on in your family, and I cannot answer for your dad’s actions or
      his reasoning behind this.
  - bot: I would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills. We
      cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us.
      If you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing
      (like your pets) then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional
      distress. It is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends,
      hobbies, games, etc. Develop other things that you care about and are passionate
      about.
  - bot: Another reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever
      might be going on in your life is if you don’t have healthy ones, you may develop
      some very unhealthy ones. You have to cope somehow, right? Developing unhealthy
      ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for you.
  - bot: I don’t know if this is what it is like for you at your house, but there
      are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children.
      One is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions
      are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything. The other
      is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to
      happen next and had no stability. People need to have some stability in their
      lives and need to feel in control over some things in order to feel safe. Both
      of these environments can lead you to develop some unhealthy ways of coping
      with life. Please talk to a trusted adult about your feelings before it gets
      any worse.

- story: My girlfriend broke up with me but I want her back.  What do I do?
  steps:
  - user: Me and my girlfriend just broke up. She said she loves me but is not in
      love anymore. This came out of nowhere. We seemed so happy together. It all
      started when she went to Missouri to visit her family. The first week she was
      there she was fine then once she went to this one sister’s house everything
      changed. That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore.
      I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted
      to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she
      told me to come to her in Missouri. So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped
      everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours
      to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again. She apologized for
      everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a
      week. Then she went back to saying she didn’t love me anymore and had no feelings
      for me. The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this
      is that now she is pregnant. This wasn’t an accident. We were trying to get
      pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. I love her so much. I have never been
      bad to her. I've treated her the best I can. I wanted her to be my wife. I was
      going to propose to her when she got back. Now I'm losing my family and my mind.
      I don't know what to do.
  - bot: I am sorry to hear of these troubles. I see a few issues here. I wonder why
      you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled?
      Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant,
      and all this does is bring up more problems.
  - bot: You say you never treated her badly, and I believe you. People in a relationship
      can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on. In
      fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a “self”
      outside of this relationship can be unhealthy. It takes two whole, healthy,
      happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make
      a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship. Expecting your partner to
      meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.
  - bot: There are two books that I recommend you buy and read. One is Codependent
      No More. The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?
  - bot: Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes
      you both miserable. You cannot change her and cannot change her mind. Sometimes
      the best thing is to let go. If it is meant to be, you will end up back together
      again. It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is
      the one that keeps doing the leaving. I suggest backing off and letting her
      go. Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind. If it is meant
      to be, she will come back. If not, use this time to work on being a healthy
      happy you on your own.

- story: I endured sexual and physical abuse by my brother as child
  steps:
  - user: Now I have anger and trust issues. How can I treat this and fix myself?
  - bot: I will assume that for whatever reason, you either do not want to or are
      not able to seek counseling for this. However, I highly urge you to do so because
      long-term childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an
      adult, as it seems you are already aware.
  - bot: There are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal
      with sexual abuse. Some/most also offer free counseling services in local areas.
      That would be a good place to start looking, especially if cost of counseling
      is an issue.
  - bot: 'The important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and
      that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past. Having anger and trust
      issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened
      to you. Angry? Yes! At your brother for what he did, at your parents for not
      protecting you. Having trouble trusting? Of course! The very people who were
      supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead. Two books that might help
      you are Codependent No More and Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin.'

- story: How can I get people to listen?
  steps:
  - user: I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties
      while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel
      that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in
      my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and
      acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust
      my own parents. I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety
      are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have
      their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try
      to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has
      been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.
  - bot: Hi there. Being 15 years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage
      life. I remember when I was 15 and how I often felt my parents weren’t listening
      to me. It’s even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend
      that you can confide in.
  - bot: Having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that
      you can get through anything! Depression alone is a very difficult problem to
      work through. In addition to the communication problem with your parents, it
      appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety. We all have stress
      and anxiety in our lives. If we didn’t, none of us would be living. Anxiety
      & stress keep us on our toes! Often, I have to remind myself of this as well.
      However, it is how we manage stress and anxiety, so it will not overcome our
      lives.
  - bot: 'Are you familiar with relaxation techniques, such as: deep breathing exercises,
      meditation or yoga? Relaxation Techniques can help you tremendously in reducing
      your stress and anxiety.'
  - bot: Deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go, such as school,
      shopping, out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage
      in. Most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity. I know, that
      sounds silly. But, it’s true. You would be surprised how much air you lungs
      can hold. Imagine being in the Doctor’s office and taking deep breaths. This
      is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed and/or stressed. Take
      a moment to take in at least 10 deep breaths and let them out slowly. You will
      be surprised how well you feel afterwards.
  - bot: Meditation and Yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and
      anxiety. You will need a quiet place for your meditation. You want to be “in
      the moment” and take in the peace and serenity. All it takes is a quiet place,
      closing your eyes and thinking of your “happy place.” Some people use meditation
      music as well. If you have access to this type of music and or the internet
      for more ways to practice meditation, please go for it!
  - bot: Yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice. I would
      not suggest you learning this on your own, if you have never attempted yoga
      before. Find an experienced Yoga instructor to teach you the ropes and/or ask
      your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the
      school to teach the students.
  - bot: Lastly, in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have
      a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating. I would recommend writing
      a letter to them, if you are unable to express how you feel in person. A letter
      is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end. If they are
      open on working on this relationship, maybe suggest family counseling to fully
      work on this issue.
  - bot: I hope this was helpful for you and I wish you the best!

- story: Dealing with an unfaithful and judgmental significant other
  steps:
  - user: I have been with this guy on and off for 8 years. At first, we used to do
      things together and our sex life was ok. Then things started to change, we'd
      break up and reconnect, and he cheated on me numerous times. We've also had
      two beautiful baby girls during this time. Now we argue and he says I am not
      affectionate at all or I don't know how to please a man, when I work part-time,
      take care of a 2 year old and a 5 month old and cook. Sometimes he cooks, but
      he also spends a lot of time on the internet. In addition, I have 2 boys and
      he has 1 son. I feel somewhere I have lost something. It's not that I don’t
      care, I truly love this guy, but I'm just tired of being the one who is always
      being judged. Please, I am in need of a Christian counselor to help us because
      I really need to speak to someone.
  - bot: I don't think you’ve lost something, I think you’ve found something - your
      breaking point, and it's about time. Your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish
      and immature man who reconnects with you when it's convenient for him. Obviously,
      he has his own issues, but I want to address yours. I agree you need to talk
      to someone. The fact that you’ve put up with his repeated cheating and then
      letting him blame you for it (by saying you're not affectionate enough, etc.),
      tells me you probably have low self-esteem and have likely told yourself over
      the years that you don't deserve any better. You do! You may truly love this
      guy, but based on his behaviors, he does not love you, not in the way you deserve.
      And although you may want to believe he can change, he has proved over and over
      again that he's not willing to, so you need to do what is best for you and your
      children. What would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this
      way? Would you want your sons to treat women this way? That's what you're teaching
      your children when they see this.
  - bot: Like I said, I agree that you should talk to someone. You can ask your boyfriend
      to go too, but my guess is he won't. Even if he does, you should still see someone
      individually to work on YOU. I understand it's not easy to just kick him out,
      especially since you have children together, but a counselor can help you talk
      through all the details while helping you raise your self-esteem and self-worth.

- story: How do I deal with my son's violent thoughts and dreams?
  steps:
  - user: My son claims that hes been having extremely violent thoughts and dreams.
      Not violent like he's hurting someone, but violent thoughts like horrible things
      happening to his loved ones. He explained one of his dreams the other day and
      it was so violent it was sickening. It was far beyond anything in a horror movie,
      he says he can't help these thoughts they just pop up. Please help!
  - bot: Let me start my stating this is important to take seriously - taking to his
      PCP, getting a referral to a pediatric specialist, and getting him to a relational
      psychotherapist would be my first tasks.
  - bot: I wont label this occurrences as "normal" yet it is important to note these
      things do occur. My first observation is to say that it is a tremendous advantage
      that your son is communicating what he is experiencing. I'd encourage him to
      continue to do so, no matter the extent of his thoughts - his trust of you being
      able the handle his experience is of utmost importance. His containment and
      sense of security is also dependent on your reaction to what he shares. Seek
      professional help, communicating your support, including a plan of action, and
      reassuring him you will figure this out together will help you as you begin.

- story: I'm experiencing panic attacks when I'm physically separated from my girlfriend
  steps:
  - user: Whenever I leave my girlfriend I get panic attacks. I'm taking medications
      to control them, but I'm thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.
  - bot: I’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks. I hope
      that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief.
      Unfortunately, I don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate
      your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body
      is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You
      may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may
      experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises.
  - bot: Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing
      panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in
      the case that one would arise in the future.
  - bot: Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along
      with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist
      you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance
      of another attack occurring.
  - bot: I wish you the best of luck! It sounds like you are very happy in your relationship
      and I hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy
      one another.

- story: How can I see my base doctor without my ID?
  steps:
  - user: I need to get on base to see my doctor. My ID card was in my wallet which
      was stolen. I’m unable to reach my husband at this time. He is only one who
      can take me on base in order to get a new ID so I can continue to see doctor.
      Is there anything I can do?
  - bot: Do you have any other form of identification? The first place to stop would
      be the Visitor’s Center or whichever department issues passes. They are located
      outside of the gate so you do not need a military ID to enter. If you have another
      form of identification it’s possible that they can give you a pass in order
      to go and obtain a new military ID.
  - bot: If you do not, you could always ask someone else to sponsor you on (a friend,
      coworker, etc.) that have military access. Depending on the threat level, they
      may not need your ID as long as you are with someone that has access. Keep in
      mind that currently (6/11/15) all military bases are on Bravo which unfortunately
      means you will need your own ID.
  - bot: Finally, if all else fails, call your doctor and explain your situation.
      I’m sure they would be more than willing to discuss your options.
  - bot: Also, it’s important to make sure that you report your wallet being stolen
      if you haven’t already. Security Forces on base can help you with this and to
      ensure your ID doesn’t get into the wrong hands.

- story: When should I give up on a relationship?
  steps:
  - user: I’ve known my boyfriend for several years. We were friends for a long time.
      In 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him
      since I lived out of state. I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished
      school and he found a job. However, during this time we had a few arguments
      and broke up with each other for a short period of time. We decided later to
      make it work. Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant. I wanted to tell
      him during his next visit. However, he never came to see me and instead asked
      me for money. After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts.
      Soon after, I experienced a miscarriage. I texted him about what had happened,
      and he didn’t seem to care. I was extremely hurt by this. I still decided to
      move back as I had originally planned. He helped me with the move and replaced
      the money I had lent him. During this time, I asked if he wanted to be in this
      relationship because I needed to know. Although he says he did, I hardly ever
      see him. He never got a job, which was in the original plan. After that, we
      both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got
      back together. Once we got back together, I cut all ties with the former relationship
      I had been in. I thought he had too. But I found out that he did not attempt
      to do as I did and was still talking with another woman. In fact, he had even
      sent inappropriate pictures to her. When I confronted him about this, he wasn’t
      apologetic. He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually
      mad at me for looking through his phone. He even closed his car window on my
      finger and tried to throw me out of his car. I don’t know what to do.
  - bot: 'There are plenty of red flags that you have been presented with:'
  - bot: Several breakups
  - bot: Not holding up his end of the bargain regarding work
  - bot: Lack of empathy for your miscarriage
  - bot: Lying about his involvement with another woman
  - bot: Physical violence, which is of most concern.
  - bot: This seems to be a very unhealthy relationship. In my experience, relationships
      such as these rarely become positive ones. Violence is never okay and regardless
      of his reasoning (you looking through his phone), it is indefensible. You have
      to look at these red flags and ask yourself, “Is this really someone I want
      to marry? Is he an asset to my life?” I think you’ll realize he is not.
  - bot: Best of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you
      with kindness, dignity and respect.

- story: How do I cope and rebuild my life after ending an 11 year abusive marriage?
  steps:
  - user: I am going through a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath who left me for
      another woman after mentally and emotionally abusing me for 11 years. I have
      moved to a different state and after giving up my successful business am working
      as a server at a restaurant. I’m coping as best as I can. Is it normal and healthy
      to not adapt as quickly and be as strong as I think I should be? I am astounded
      at his cruelty and how much he doesn't care, as well as most other people in
      my life. I feel like I don't exist to anyone anymore as there is no contact
      from anyone who I thought cared about me. My brother just said no to lending
      me a few hundred dollars for me to live on. I am losing faith in humanity itself.
  - bot: I am very sorry to hear of your struggles. I think that it is normal to struggle
      to get your feet under you again after a divorce, especially after leaving a
      relationship that lasted 11 years, so try not to be too hard on yourself. Take
      it one day at a time and do the best you can.
  - bot: I notice that you said he left you. This tells me that you didn’t have the
      strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally
      and mentally abusive and also cheating on you. Low self-esteem can keep someone
      in a bad relationship because they think they can’t do any better. Also, abusers
      will make you think that they are the best thing you can get. The way I see
      it, he did you a favor. You are now free to make your own life whatever you
      want it to be.
  - bot: Take this time alone to work on you. As hurtful as it may be that other people
      don’t want to help you, this is something that you need to do for yourself without
      feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you. Your statement
      “I don’t feel like I exist anymore” tells me that in addition to low self-esteem,
      you also don’t have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your
      life to help define who you are. People can and will let you down. It is important
      for you to learn to handle disappointment, learn to take care of your own needs,
      and to gain a stronger sense of self.
  - bot: Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it. Even if it
      is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath, do something that makes
      you feel good. Find a hobby that you enjoy. Look in the mirror and tell yourself
      some positive affirmations daily. Google “positive affirmations” to find some
      that resonate with you. Such statements might be “I am a good person who deserves
      to be happy” or “I can do this.” Some relaxation and meditation exercises may
      help you as well. There are some free meditation exercises that you can find
      online by doing a simple Google search.
  - bot: Take this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else
      in your life is doing. When you are a happier, more stable person, the right
      people will come into your life without you even looking for them. Good luck
      with rebuilding your life. I know it is hard! Remember to take it one day at
      a time.

- story: I'm going through depression right now and my relationship is suffering
  steps:
  - user: I've been married for 3 years and I have two kids. During my 3-years married,
      my husband cheated on me twice. The second time really got to me and at my lowest
      I hurt him back. We aren't communicating as well as I would like. What do I
      do?
  - bot: Hi there. Thank you reaching out for help. It takes a lot of courage for
      someone that is being abused to reach out for help. I want you to know that
      I am here to help you in any way that I can.
  - bot: First and foremost, you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself
      by this man. I’m going to assume there are. So, the most important thing right
      at this moment is asking yourself, if you and your children are safe? Is the
      boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going? If he is coming
      and going or currently living in the home, my suggestion for you to is to pack
      a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe (i.e. family members home,
      friend or a shelter temporarily). I cannot stress this enough. Although, some
      people tend to minimize their abusers behavior (i.e. they only do it when they
      are drinking, they only do it when they are mad), it’s those individuals that
      find themselves or their children in a serious situation. So, you can never
      take abuse (physical or mental) lightly because you never know what is going
      through that persons mind at that particular time. It’s always better to be
      safe than sorry.
  - bot: Secondly, it will not be safe, helpful or productive to attempt to talk to
      the abuser about your relationship. Abusers often times try and manipulate you
      into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors. This is
      the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective
      order for you and your children.
  - bot: It’s unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women
      causing pregnancy; however, that is no longer your concern. Your concern at
      this point is keeping yourself and your children safe. I would also suggest
      counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues.
      I hope this was helpful and please stay safe and take care of yourself.

- story: How can I let go of my dream wedding?
  steps:
  - user: I have been with my husband for almost 7 years. We got engaged a little
      after 5 years of being together. I had always been clear that I wanted to get
      married and I sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose. When
      he did propose it was during a random vacation that I had planned. I was happy
      but I couldn't help feeling disappointed too. I had told him numerous times
      before that I wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family. I know
      it sounds dumb to be upset but I couldn't help how I was feeling. We are now
      married but the wedding and ring were also far from what I wanted and it wasn't
      due to lack of funds. I know this is all material and the marriage is the most
      important thing but I cant help but get jealous and envious every time I see
      someone get a proposal or wedding that I had wanted. I cant help my anger because
      I know we only get one proposal and one wedding. What I wanted will never happen.
      I have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it.
      I try to focus on our marriage but every time I see someone have the best proposals
      and weddings I get upset. I know it is selfish and I know its petty but I just
      can't control it. It's ruining our relationship because I constantly think about
      it. Plus, I get mad at him for small things because I am trying to hide the
      fact that I am so disappointed. Why can't I move on?
  - bot: It's hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement.
      This was something that you and most women think about for years, so it's understandable
      to be disappointed. But please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is
      perfect. You may envy your friends' weddings but more than likely they had a
      few mishaps of their own and/or it wasn't as perfect as they had planned it
      either.
  - bot: However, like you know, the marriage is the most important thing. How many
      women are envious that you are in a happy, stable relationship? I assure you
      that there are plenty.
  - bot: Try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still
      not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired. Focus
      on what you can control NOW. Perhaps, you can plan an extravagant renewal of
      your vows or change the look of your ring?
  - bot: I would also be upfront with your husband and explain why you've been short
      lately. But after that, close that chapter and move on. It sounds like you have
      a wonderful companion and you certainly don't want to lose this due to a situation
      that is impossible to change.

- story: How do I stop grieving my mother’s death?
  steps:
  - user: What can I do to stop grieving my mother’s death? When I am awake I just
      cry every day. I don't have anyone to talk to. I need help; I am still cry over
      her. Will I ever stop crying? It’s been 3 years.
  - bot: I am sorry that you lost your mother. That is a really hard thing for someone
      to go through.
  - bot: There is really no set time for grief to be over, but I agree that if it
      has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the
      time for normal grief. I do not know how old you are and if you are in school
      or have a job, but I would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing
      but crying every day all day, someone would have noticed and would have gotten
      you some help. For one thing, bills have to be paid.
  - bot: There are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order.
      You can go back to another stage that you previously experienced. Denial, anger,
      bargaining, depression, and acceptance are the stages.
  - bot: At first, people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone
      or are losing someone. This may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that
      they have actually died.
  - bot: Then comes bargaining, in which you may beg God that if you can only have
      this person back then you will do whatever.
  - bot: Depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really
      feel the loss. It sounds like you are stuck in this phase.
  - bot: Finally, acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up
      the pieces of our life and move on.
  - bot: When we lose someone we never forget them. We may always have certain days
      that are tough, such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one.
      But we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that
      it is inevitable, and that life goes on.
  - bot: A therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and
      can help you with coping skills to better deal with it. One suggestion I have
      is not to try to run from the sad feelings, don’t try to not feel them. Embrace
      the feelings. Let the feelings wash over you and accept them. Trying not to
      feel something is not going to help. Sadness is a part of life and needs to
      be felt just like happiness does. Unpleasant feelings are not to be avoided.
  - bot: I am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such
      a hard time of it for three years now. You deserve to be happy and to live a
      full life. I am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long. I
      wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal
      with your grief.

  steps:
  - user: I'm having issues with my relative. The police never believe the experiences
      I have been through because I am only a kid. I've even had trouble trying to
      reach a therapist because I said I wanted to get an adult to help me. Could
      you please give me advice?
  - bot: I think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for
      children. It's called the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline. The number
      is 1-800-4-A-CHILD (1-800-422-4453).
  - bot: It is completely anonymous and a trained therapist will be able to provide
      you with guidance, confidentiality, and can also help you make a report of you
      want.
  - bot: The call is completely free and they are open 24 hours a day / 7 days a week.

- story: How do I fix my marriage?
  steps:
  - user: My wife just last week said she wants a divorce and it's all sudden. I understand
      that marriages have their ups and downs but I don't understand why she can't
      tell me why she wants a divorce. Should I fight for my family (daughter and
      wife)?
  - bot: Chances are, if you really think about it, there were signs that something
      wasn’t quite right in your marriage. You may have passed these things off as
      being the normal ups and downs of a marriage, but whatever it was (or wasn't),
      it's obviously bothering your wife. I would say yes, keep trying to fight for
      your family, at least until you know what the problems are from your wife's
      perspective and if they're repairable. Ask your wife if she’s willing to try
      to work on the marriage and then see a marriage counselor. Just be sure you’re
      open to hearing what's said and try not to get defensive if she blames you for
      some things.
  - bot: Even if your wife is adamant about getting a divorce, that doesn't mean you’re
      divorcing your daughter and you should make sure she knows that. Continue to
      be a part of her life. And although it may be difficult, if a divorce does happen,
      try to be as amicable as possible with your wife so your daughter isn't further
      impacted by this new family dynamic.

  steps:
  - user: I loved him more than anything. He passed away on our anniversary which
      was also the day I was going to apply for our apartment. I'm not handling it
      well. I moved to a new town and started a new life but nothing helps.
  - bot: I am so sorry to hear of your boyfriend's passing. Grief is something that
      can take a long time to recover from. Have you considered speaking with a grief
      counselor? Being able to speak with someone that specializes in grief would
      be very beneficial.
  - bot: Do not get down on yourself for not recovering quickly. This is one of the
      hardest aspects to deal with in life but eventually you will be able to move
      forward.
  - bot: In the mean time, immerse yourself with positivity (i.e. Good friends, hobbies,
      exercise) and try to schedule a time with a counselor.
  - bot: Perhaps there will be a support group you could also join. Oftentimes, it
      is comforting to meet others who share the same experience as you.

  steps:
  - user: I did some horrible sexual things as a kid and I regret everything. Can
      someone help me cope with myself? Can someone help me remember my past?
  - bot: I'm very sorry to hear this. Hypnosis can be a valuable tool that a trained
      therapist can use to bring back suppressed memories. However, keep in mind that
      hypnosis doesn't work for everyone.
  - bot: I think regardless, speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would
      be beneficial. It seems like you have experienced some painful experiences in
      the past and may need help dealing with them in order to move forward.
  - bot: In addition, if past memories do resurface a trained therapist will be able

- story: How do I choose between two guys?
  steps:
  - user: I have been with a guy for 4 years, he's a great guy and we also have a
      son together. The problem is that I'm in love with a guy that I've been talking
      to for about 2 years but I've never met him in person. Honestly I'm bored with
      the relationship I have with the first guy and he makes want to go after the
      second guy, I don't know how to tell him that. What should I do?
  - bot: Hi there. Wow, this sounds like a sticky situation; however, I’m here to
      help guide you through this decision.
  - bot: First and foremost, you must ask yourself, if you ever loved your sons’ father
      or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for
      the child. It’s very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved
      regardless, if love is involved or not because “it’s the right thing to do.”
      Right? Well, not entirely. Although, staying with your partner because you have
      a child together may seem right, in fact, it hurts the child in the long run.
      If you are not love with your partner, you will show distance, unhappiness,
      sadness, possibility of frequent arguments and cheating. When a child grows
      up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions & behaviors it is unhealthy
      as he/she will expect their own relationships to be such. As a responsible adult,
      you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child. Just
      remember, what you do, your child will model.
  - bot: Secondly, do not sell yourself short from love. Everyone deserves to be happy
      and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with. However, being in
      love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky. Honestly, that
      sounds like lust and the longing of love. Humans have needs and when people
      are unhappy in their current relationship, they often seek out what they need.
      If you decide to pursue the second relationship, I would suggest setting up
      an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there
      are a lot of scammers these days.
  - bot: Finally, I am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between
      two guys. This seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship
      with your child’s father or not. You should ask yourself, if you were in love
      with your child’s father first off. If you were, you would have never sought
      after love. I hope this was helpful for you and I hope I was able to shed a
      different light on your situation. Take care of yourself!

- story: What should I do if my boyfriend can't get over my past?
  steps:
  - user: My boyfriend can't get over my promiscuous past. He says he loves me but
      says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual distraction. He says
      he should have had more sex with different people. I don't know how to handle
      this.
  - bot: I am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles.
  - bot: One thing I wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or
      is this something that he asked about? In the future, it is probably best to
      leave details out of conversations like this. I think it is common and natural
      for partners to ask about the sexual history. For one thing, it is a good idea
      to be checked for STD’s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone,
      and it is fair to share that information with each other. Partners usually want
      to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you
      have or if there is anything you don’t like to do. This gets into a gray area
      for some people. I don’t necessarily want to know how many people my partner
      has been with and I certainly don’t want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that
      is an image I just don’t want in my head about my partner. Vague details are
      usually enough.
  - bot: However, I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy
      with your past. This is a reflection on him, not you. This shows insecurities
      on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide
      to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should
      remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If
      he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You
      can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen
      relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It
      takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though.
  - bot: If your boyfriend cannot get over your past, you may have to let him go.
      Don’t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding
      your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring
      you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low self-esteem
      due to this type of treatment. I don’t see that you have done anything wrong.
      If you aren’t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your
      past honestly, how he handles that information is on him. Ultimately, relationships
      have a tendency to come and go. Don’t fight to hold onto someone who is not
      right for you. It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you
      can be. In time, the right person for you will enter your life.

  steps:
  - user: What do I do if I have been feeling like I could never be with anyone because
      no one would want me. Or I couldn't have many friends because of who I am. It's
      strange I want to be loved but I'd hate to be because I always lose.
  - bot: I'm sorry you are feeling uncared for. I'm sure there are plenty of people
      that care and love for you that you are not taking into consideration. Sometimes
      when we get upset we may think irrationally and see the world as all or nothing.
      However, take a deep breath, relax and start focusing on the positive relationships
      you have with others, regardless of how small or insignificant they may seem.
      I think you will quickly realize there are people out there that care a great
      deal about you.
  - bot: I also think it would help for you to surround yourself among people who
      you can identify with and share common interests with. Maybe you can attend
      a religious service, join an interest group (i.e. reading club, sports group,
      etc.) or start a group of your own. Most importantly, you need to tap into your
      interests and surround yourself with things that are beneficial for your own
      mental and physical health. From this, relationships will start to immerse.
  - bot: You may also like to talk with a therapist regarding your feelings of being
      unloved. This is an unhealthy way to think of yourself and I think with a little
      help, you can see that you are more than deserving of a great relationship.

      old girl? This has been going on for 4 years. The boy tells my daughter not
      to tell on him. He knows it's wrong; we have did time out, spanking, taking
      away toys, and sitting on the wall. I am afraid for my daughters safety!
  - bot: I can see why you are alarmed. That is a scary situation for a parent. Do
      you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional? Early
      treatment is often the key. A professional will be able to help the child learn
      how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate
      responses.
  - bot: Have you addressed your concerns with the child's other parent? There could
      be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues (exposure
      to violence, sexual/physical abuse, drug use, stressful events in his life,
      etc.). It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either
      be eliminated and/or reduced.
  - bot: I wouldn't hesitate to have him evaluated (if he hasn't been already) and
      to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication
      and/or therapy. Until then, I would make sure that he is always supervised under

      I do?
  - bot: This is difficult to answer because you don’t tell us what the fetish is.
      I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though.
  - bot: The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or
      not. If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help
      immediately to control the urges.
  - bot: However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it
      is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings.
      You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed
      of. You may find other people have the same interest as you. Find a therapist
      that you can trust and tell them. Don’t hold back with your therapist. Trust
      me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop
      the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting
      the behavior as part of who you are. There is no need to suffer with this alone.

      see a therapist of their choice?
  - bot: I can’t give you legal advice, but employers can suggest you see someone
      if your behavior is affecting your job. I believe most government agencies have
      an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) where employees can talk to a therapist
      about any issue, not just work-related, for free (up to a certain amount of
      sessions).
  - bot: I’m wondering, though, why your coworkers would tell your boss this if it’s
      not true. Is it possible that you're not aware of how your interactions are
      affecting others? Maybe this “forced counseling” can be an opportunity for some
      introspection on your part.

  steps:
  - user: I'm in a state of depression right now. Who can I talk to? I've been sick
      in a lot of pain and crying. Don't know where to turn.
  - bot: First of all, if you’re sick and in pain, have you seen your doctor? If you
      have a chronic illness and pain, this can often lead to depression and is very
      common. You’ve taken the first step to dealing with it. You can talk to your
      doctor, even if your depression isn’t related to your health. He or she can
      either look at prescribing you an antidepressant or can refer you to a psychologist
      or psychiatrist.
  - bot: If that’s not really an option for you, there are also helplines (local or
      national) or support groups where people dealing with similar issues can talk
      to each other. If you can't find any in your area (newspapers usually publish

      etc. Whenever I have an opinion it gets shut down. My mom and everyone else
      behaves likewise. For my father who heads a company, this is normal. He has
      to be right all the time. He blatantly refuses to even try to see it from my
      angle. Recently however, it's been getting to the point where I feel pressured
      and unable to speak my mind. It isn't possible for me to get professional one-on-one
      help. He tells me to grow a pair and get over it. I recently have been developing
      more severe body image and self-confidence issues, which I have had all my life.

      turn on location services anymore on my phone because of a past incident. He
      makes me feel guilty about it. I feel rather worthless more often than not,
      unfortunately. What do I do?
  - bot: I'm sorry to hear that you are unable to get through to your parents. It
      sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety that needs to be addressed
      by a professional (despite the fact that you are unable to at the moment). I
      would recommend talking with another adult such as a school counselor that can
      offer you support in this area. Perhaps they can work with you on your anxiety
      issues and schedule a meeting with your parents so that he/she may help mediate
      the conversation with them.
  - bot: If you are unable to reach out to a school counselor maybe you can try a
      member of the family such as an aunt or an uncle that feels comfortable addressing
      the issue with your parents. Sometimes it helps hearing it from a third party
      before the situations is taken seriously enough.

  - user: I'm a 40 year old male and having erection problems. Still have the desire
      for a woman. Awfully frustrated. Any suggestions? My Doc doesn't want to discuss
      it.
  - bot: Hi there, first off I have to commend you for reaching out. It takes a lot
      for a man to reach out for help when it comes to erection problems. Believe
      it or not, this problem is very common for men and women.
  - bot: There are some things that you can try naturally, before resulting in medication,
      such as your eating habits and exercise. I would suggest taking a look at what
      you are consuming throughout the day. Do you consume a healthy diet and do you
      exercise regularly? How much caffeine and sugar do you intake daily? These are
      just a few common things to look at. You would be surprised of how much pressure
      what we consume puts on our bodies. Our bodies are like a car. You have to maintenance
      it, in order for it to continue to run.
  - bot: If you would like to get further natural advice and/or suggestions on eating
      healthy and exercising, I would recommend you see a nutritionist. A nutritionist
      specializes in maintaining a healthy diet. As far as your Doctor, I would recommend
      looking into getting another Doctor. I have never heard of a medical professional
      not wanting to talk about anything. That appears to be a personal issue on their

      is very hard to get over so if it's taking you awhile to get over, know that

      and he should understand this.
  - bot: It's also very important to discuss WHY he cheated. You want to make sure
      that the reasoning behind this was not something that could arise again in the
      future. And if it can, there needs to be an action plan in place (i.e. being
      honest with how he's feeling) so that you both get a chance to rectify the situation.
  - bot: If the cheating has happened more than once, you may want to reevaluate your
      reasoning for staying in the marriage. It would be obvious that he did not truly
      regret what he had done or else he wouldn't repeat the same mistake. However,
      if it was a single event and he has shown you and continuously shows you that
      he genuinely loves you and is sorry for his mistake, I would give it a try.
      People do make mistakes and sometimes it takes an event like this to realize
      what you have.
  - bot: Know that it takes time and that you have the right to feel what you feel.
      If the relationship was a good, healthy relationship, it is worth saving. Ease
      back into it and be upfront with your feelings. In return, your husband should
      be patient and understanding of this.
  - bot: Also, marriage counselors are often a good go-to as they have a great deal
      of experience working with marriages in similar situations.

- story: Why do I keep getting with men that emotionally abuse me?
  steps:
  - user: I've been abused emotionally all of my life and for some reason I keep getting
      with men that I let emotionally abused me. How can I stop it? I know the mistakes
      that I've made in my life. I'm having a really hard time getting back on my
      feet. Can you help me please?
  - bot: I want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this
      is an issue and wanting to do something about it. You are already on the road
      to a happier life with this realization. A lot of women do not recognize that
      it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and
      will only blame it on the men for treating them that way. Until you realize
      there is a problem you won’t start looking for a solution.
  - bot: Don’t misunderstand me! The abuse is not your fault! You are seeing a pattern,
      though, so this does need to be addressed.
  - bot: 'First, go and buy the book “Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin” by Anne
      Katherine. Read it. This book describes many situations that are similar to
      yours, describes how a person came to be that way, and how to stop it. You will
      have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain them.'
  - bot: Be single for a while. Stay single until you feel like a whole, healthy,
      happy person on your own. Often we get in a relationship because of a need.
      If you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then
      you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons. The first step is to work on
      whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your
      life. Identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your own.
  - bot: I was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally
      abusive to the wife. This was a recurrent theme for her, like you are saying
      it is for you. However, she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private
      therapy, and this was a new relationship. Obviously she still had not “gotten
      it right” because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies. The
      difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had
      become a stronger person. When she looked at him in our session and said to
      him “I don’t need you. I want you. But not if you are going to continue to act
      like this. So you leave the house and don’t come back until you are ready to
      make some changes.” She stuck to that, too. He didn’t leave for two more days
      because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed
      to stay. She had drawn a boundary and stuck to it, and he left. She was fully
      prepared to be single again. They actually did end up working things out in
      the end.
  - bot: You can’t let someone stay and continue to treat you badly. Sure, a marriage
      takes work and compromise on both sides. Couples therapy can help you both learn
      to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what
      areas in the relationship need work. You may not realize how some of the things
      you say to him comes across, and he may not realize how what he says does to
      you. A therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words
      can hurt. But you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them
      and not compromise your boundaries. That means following through on the threat
      to leave when he continues to abuse you. Someone can’t do that if they are too
      scared to be alone. If they feel they need the other person in their life.
  - bot: These patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our
      parents. When someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family, it is all they
      know. Even when you can say that you realize it is a problem, you still don’t
      know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with
      people. Something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome.
      Be patient with yourself and find a good therapist. You can’t change your partner.
      Work on you, and when you begin to heal and feel healthy, the right people will
      come into your life and stay. The more you focus on trying to change the wrong
      ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become.

- story: How can I determine if I should be a boy or girl?
  steps:
  - user: I feel like I would be more comfortable as a girl even though I still like
      girls. I think I'm like a girl stuck in a guy body. I imagine myself as a girl
      too. I think this more because my friends say that if I was a girl I would be
      a hot looking one. And I don't care about having boobs or anything. I just feel
      like the way that I do act will make more sense if I was a girl.
  - bot: I understand that gender and/or sexual identity crises can be very difficult
      to navigate, although in today’s time I think we have made a lot of progress
      and it is becoming easier for individuals to find themselves and also find acceptance
      from society.
  - bot: I am unsure how old you are. If you are a child or teenager, this is a normal
      time to have identity questions and to be in a phase where you are trying to
      figure out who you are and what you want out of life. I hope that you have understanding
      and supportive friends and family that you can talk to and who will support
      you in how you feel and what you may decide to do. A lot of people, unfortunately,
      do not, and if this is the case then it makes it harder for you. Because then
      you may not feel safe exploring these feelings and decisions.
  - bot: I urge you not to try to make any permanent changes for quite some time.
      By this I mean a sex change. Anything permanent like surgery or hormone replacement
      to change your actual gender is something that does not need to be done lightly.
      Please find a therapist that can help you explore your feelings and your identity
      crisis. Of course there are things that you can do that are not permanent changes.
      Many people decide to dress like their gender of choice. Maybe experimenting
      in this way is something that you could do.
  - bot: See if you have a local chapter of PFLAG in your area. PFLAG stands for Parents,
      Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. They are able to help not only with
      those who identify as lesbian or gay, but also transgendered and asexual.
  - bot: I wish you all the best in your identity crisis. It would be very easy for
      you to sink into depression if you do not have good support and understanding
      from those around you during this time. Find a professional that can help, especially
      if you experience depression or any thoughts of harming yourself.

- story: How do I get over anxiety, depression, and isolation?
  steps:
  - user: I've have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot
      better, but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation?
  - bot: The best way to handle depression and anxiety is with a combination of appropriate
      medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand
      the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the depression and anxiety
      in the first place and then to replace these with more positive thoughts and
      behaviors. This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and
      try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is
      a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes
      a therapist trained in CBT.
  - bot: There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept.
      A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control
      over. This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a
      situation that you cannot change, such as the recent death of a loved one, a
      lost relationship, or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped.
      In cases like this, what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the
      situation that you now find yourself in. One thing that is inevitable about
      life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant. Some people take these
      unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression.
      Other people seem to be able to handle life’s ups and downs and bounce back.
      They do this with having positive coping skills in their life. Learning new
      coping skills is something your therapist can help you with.
  - bot: A lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life
      that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change. There
      are things that you can do. Here is a quote for you to consider. “You are getting
      almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made.
      You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes.”
      Another quote I like is “You will find a way or you will find an excuse.” Don’t
      ever say that you have no choice. Everyone has a choice. You might not particularly
      like any of the choices that you are facing, but you do have choices. Not happy
      in a relationship? You can leave it. Hate your job? Get a new one. If it matters
      to you, you will find a way. Don’t sit there complaining about everything but
      not doing anything different or better.
  - bot: Take care of yourself. Exercise is very important not only for your physical
      health, but for your mental health as well. Eating right and exercising will
      help you feel better about yourself. Also, find a meditation that works for
      you. There are progressive muscle relaxation exercises, visual and mental meditations,
      and many many more. Start making some positive changes in your life today! You
      can do it!

- story: What do I do about a cousin who makes me feel belittled, insecure and frustrated?
  steps:
  - user: 'Hello, I have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled,
      insecure, and frustrated during her stay here in the city. I know she comes
      from a place of love, but she has always been short-fused and highly temperamental
      if something doesn''t work out the way she planned it. I have tried my best
      to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack
      of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments
      about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self
      consumed. I have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes
      back as an attack on my character and I have never heard these comments from
      anyone else before. I have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether
      I truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of
      surroundings/people, or positive, but in the end, I am feeling awfully hurt
      about how this has affected our relationship. What can I do?'
  - bot: Do you have a close friend or relative who's opinion you trust? Ask them
      for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does. If they
      don’t see these qualities in you, then it may be your cousin’s issue and she’s
      taking it out on you. You can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate
      plans with her so you know, specifically, what she is expecting. Then if you
      meet these expectations and she still blames you and comments on how inconsiderate
      you are, it's her issue and she is not coming from a place of love.
  - bot: Even if you do resemble her comments, the way it sounds like she approaches
      this problem is not out of love. The fact that you're introspective enough to
      consider your own behavior suggests the problem is not with you.

- story: I have a son with my girlfriend, but she is emotionally abusive. What do
    I do?
  steps:
  - user: I have a child with my baby mother. She works I take care of our young son.
      She says she is not cheating I have not found anything but she always putting
      me down, telling me to get out and telling me she doesn't love me, but then
      the next day after our fight she says she does. I'm having a hard time because
      before our child she said she was raped by a family member but she never went
      to the hospital or the cops. Now me and my family don't talk. She's always telling
      me I'm annoying and just belittles me. Nothing I do is right. She says I work
      you watch the baby. On her days off she never cooks or cleans. I have no friends
      or family and a couple months ago she was confiding to some guy, but says he's
      not any thing to her. What do I do? I don't want to leave.
  - bot: It sounds like you are in a tough situation. You have to ask yourself why
      you don't want to leave her. Is it because of the child? Or is it because you
      want the relationship to work? You must consider that being in an abusive relationship
      is not healthy for you or your child. So if the abuse continues, it would be
      more beneficial for you and your child to move out.
  - bot: On the other hand, if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite
      its current state, you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging.
      It seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship.
      Although your question revealed just a short bit of information, I didn't read
      about any positives in the relationship.
  - bot: Sometimes it's extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know
      that the relationship itself is harmful for you. However, with time and focus
      you can do it. Each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself
      that you are making the right situation for you and your child.
  - bot: However, if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship, you
      have to be upfront with her. You need to tell her exactly how you feel and give
      her specific examples of how she is hurting you. This gives her a chance to
      render the situation. If after this there is no improvement, I suggest that
      you start reconsidering your decision to stay.
  - bot: I also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside
      of the home that make you happy. Are there any hobbies you enjoy? Are there
      any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow
      you to engage with other parents? Start looking into these options and finding
      an avenue for you to do something for your own benefit.
  - bot: It is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and
      family. You need to have additional support networks besides the one with your
      girlfriend, especially since this has not been a healthy environment lately.
  - bot: Thank you for reaching out. I wish you the best of luck with your relationship.

- story: What can I do to help my dad stop drinking?
  steps:
  - user: Or how to send him somewhere that can help him, something like The Baker
      Act.
  - bot: More information would be needed for me to accurately answer this question,
      such as your age, whether you live with your dad or not, and what other family
      members live in the household.
  - bot: Something like this, alcoholism, is a whole family disease. In other words,
      family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the
      alcoholic to continue the destructive behavior.
  - bot: First of all, you can’t make your dad do anything, and constantly nagging
      him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this
      worse. Nobody can change another person. What you can do is change how you react
      to him and the things that you and other family members do for him.
  - bot: Research codependency. There’s a great book called Codependent No More. There
      are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read. In short, you have
      to stop enabling him. Like I said, you cannot control him, but you can control
      yourself. This means do not buy his alcohol. Do not make it easy for him to
      get. Don’t loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him. Don’t call
      in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way. Do not bail him
      out of jail when he gets arrested. He needs to be responsible for himself. This
      may mean losing his job or losing his driver’s license. This may mean that he
      loses his family if he doesn’t stop.
  - bot: What you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put
      up with. It is his choice to drink, but it is your choice to put up with the
      behaviors of his drinking. A lot of people go into rehab because their spouse
      said if they don’t then they are getting a divorce.
  - bot: If you are an adult and you don’t live with your dad, then the best thing
      you can do for him is STOP doing things for him. If you are a child who lives
      at home with him, then this could be a case for child protective services. In
      my state this is called DHS. A report is made to this organization for child
      abuse or neglect. Substance abuse in the home qualifies. Of course, alcohol
      is legal and when consumed in moderation, there is no problems. The problem
      will be the result of his alcohol consumption. Does he drive with children in
      the car while intoxicated? Is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated
      state? Are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking? This could
      be a reason for the authorities to step in.

  - bot: You can look for a local meeting for family members of alcoholics. They are

- story: My son and family has different views about religion. How do I resolve these
    differences?
  steps:
  - user: In particular during family gatherings (such as funerals), where there are
      different customs.
  - bot: I think the best thing you can do is be respectful of each family member's
      wishes. Although everyone may not agree with one another, the most important
      thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead
      of trying to sway them in a certain direction.
  - bot: There are many families that are united despite their differences. For example,
      a mother may be Catholic and the father Jewish. By introducing the children
      to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial.
  - bot: Also, it's not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different
      life experiences. So don't get too discouraged if your child wants to explore
      different avenues.

      I'll talk fast, and I want to do things. But lately I've been staying up way
      later and sleeping too much. I don't hang out with friends, I don't really have
      them. I feel nothing, worthless. I want to do nothing, I have no interest in
      anything. All I usually do is stay in my room. I want to be happy, I want to
      be nice. What's wrong with me?
  - bot: I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling as if you're in a slump. First of
      all, nothing is wrong with you. Many people report similar symptoms. Have you
      ever talked with a physician regarding your symptoms? Two extreme emotions such
      as feeling extremely happy and then feeling extremely low for a length of time
      may indicate a mood disorder. I think it would be best to talk with your doctor
      or a therapist to help pinpoint the issue causing them.
  - bot: It's possible that it could just be certain stressors in your life that are
      causing the two extremities but you definitely want to rule out any mental health
      issues. If it is in fact mental health related there are many medications or
      therapy choices that can help.

  steps:

      status. I'm just so unsure of how to ask my doctor about seeing someone.
  - bot: Thanks for your question. I'm glad you realize that you need extra support
      and are being proactive. Simply explain to your doctor the feelings you have
      been experiencing and how you feel that speaking with a mental health therapist
      would be beneficial. However, keep in mind that you do not have to go into detail
      about your personal feelings. You can simply state that you are feeling down,
      overwhelmed, stressed, or whatever it may be.

      truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that
      Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself,
      what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is
      an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when
      we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now
      when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.
  - bot: Time management is a very important factor when learning to "live life to
      the fullest"! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now.
      Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you
      would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with
      a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list.
      That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little
      things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play.
      A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There
      is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then
      maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure
      you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding
      you that this is a time for play and not work.
  - bot: These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has
      their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please
      don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!

  - bot: Having this kind of conversation with a doctor can feel difficult. But remember,
      you are the expert on you. Any good medical professional will recognize that.
  - bot: You are absolutely right to think about the importance of being your own
      health care advocate. Generally, the best approach is simply to be honest. Let
      your doctor know what you are concerned about and tell your doctor what you
      think might help. If there is a specific issue that you’d like to address in
      counseling, let you doctor know about it. And don’t hesitate to directly ask
      for a referral.
  - bot: I know this may all feel a little overwhelming. It might help to bring a
      family member or significant-other with you to provide support when you talk

    do I do?
  steps:
  - user: My last relationships have ended horribly. They just up and abandoned me.
      One of them I have never gotten closure with over it, leaving me emotionally
      wrecked. I know something's wrong with me but I don't know how to even start
      trying to better myself. I get into these depressed like states whenever anyone
      I care about is too busy to be with me. I know that I shouldn't act like that
      because people are genuinely busy, but I feel like they're doing it just because
      they don't want to be around me.
  - bot: 'Frequently when working with clients, I utilize the A-B-C model developed
      by Albert Ellis, the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Theory. The theory
      basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your
      reaction to the emotions associated with said event. For instance here is an
      example:'
  - bot: A (Action or Event)
  - bot: ': You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.'
  - bot: B (Behavior or Response)
  - bot: ': You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am
      not important to this person.'
  - bot: C (Consequence)
  - bot: ': You feel depressed.'
  - bot: 'If you look at the model, B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if
      you change your reaction to A, then C will have a better consequence, such as:'
  - bot: A
  - bot: ': stays the same.'
  - bot: B (this is what you change)
  - bot: ': This person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance
      or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.'
  - bot: C
  - bot: ': Decreased feelings of depression & overall functioning improves.'
  - bot: This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative
      thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook
      and mood will improve. If this model resonates with you, I recommend "Feeling
      better, getting better, staying better" by Alber Ellis. In addition, looking
      for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling
      abandoned or alone.

  steps:
  - user: I haven't uttered one word to my boyfriend in days. Now I'm over it and
      don't know how to approach the situation?
  - bot: In any relationship, it is important to be able to say "I'm sorry" because
      it shows vulnerability and openness. I recommend that you sit and have a discussion
      with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like
      to handle such incidents in the future. If you find yourself becoming upset
      again, I encourage you to take a 20 minute break and then come back to the conversation
      once you are no longer heated. Studies show that talking or discussing arguments
      are more effective once you have cooled down and you are more likely to hear/understand
      what your partner is trying to convey.

- story: How do I get out of an abusive relationship?
  steps:
  - user: I've been with my boyfriend over 3 years. He cheated on me and the woman
      is now pregnant. He is physically and mentally abusive towards me. I have attempted
      to talk with him in order to resolve our issues; however, he never wants to
      talk and often blames me for everything. I’m always there when he needs my help.
      He tells me although I help him doesn’t mean that I am a good person. He always
      discredits me as a woman and it’s hurtful. I spend most day crying and feeling
      lonely. I am unhappy and unsure of what I need to do.
  - bot: That sounds like a very hurtful situation. Unfortunately, without a batterers
      intervention course or a desire to change, the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop.
      I do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most
      dangerous time when in an abusive relationship. As an abuser, his goal is to
      control you whether it's through mental or verbal means. I recommend that you
      contact a domestic violence shelter in your area. I have worked closely with
      Harbor House of Central Florida and know they provide housing, transportation,
      and any other needed resources to women leaving an abusive relationship. There
      is help out there and you are not alone. If you need any additional resources
      in your area, please don't hesitate to contact me.

  steps:
  - user: I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender
      but he didn't do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender
      and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record
      since. I always believe the past should be left in past. But my roommates, their
      family and my son are unforgiving. Should I forgive this man that I'm falling
      in love with or should I dump him? If I stay with him I will never see my family
      and granddaughter again.
  - bot: Thank you for your question. Trust is a huge thing in relationships and when
      that is broken, or perceived as being broken, it takes a long time to repair.
      From what you shared, it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the
      situation and has shown to be trustworthy since. Unfortunately, no matter how
      much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did,
      there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive. If you
      feel confident in your relationship, then trust your inner wisdom. We cannot
      control others but only ourselves. Respect your families wishes to remain in
      unforgiveness while at the same time, ask them to respect your wish to believe
      in him and be in this relationship. Good luck to you.

  - bot: Hey! I am so impressed with your efforts to ask questions, to figure out
      how to change the messages that you hear (and say to yourself), and to get support!
      And it sounds like you want to make some changes in your life! Take a walk over
      to the counseling office at school, the school nurse or consider reaching out
      to your Pediatrician’s office. You don’t have to have your parent’s permission
      to seek support for yourself! And maybe taking control of your support network
      will give you the strength to make even bigger decisions about your health!
      I am rooting for you! Be Wise!

    off about my feelings and problems.
  steps:
  - user: A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues
      for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that
      I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality,
      etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the
      next morning. Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go
      back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now
      I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldn't
      matter. I feel helpless and I don't know what to do.
  - bot: Hey! It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone! And it
      sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough
      to explore some of your more painful feelings. A big part of the process, however,
      of strengthening your self-concept is learning how to tell yourself those positive
      messages that you heard from your friend! Leaving for college may also be contributing
      to your feelings of unsteadiness. Try this - Make a list of all of the positive
      things that you know are true about yourself. Ask your friends and family to
      contribute to the list. Then carry it with you in your wallet - and when you
      need a self-esteem boost, take a look at it! You are in a season of life that
      presents lots of challenges and opportunities. Reach out to your long-distance
      friend when you need support - and take a walk over to the campus counseling
      center and check out what they might have to offer. Be Wise!

  steps:
  - user: When having sex I think of other men and want other men all day long. Been
      married 3 years, together 14. What do you think?
  - bot: Sustaining passion in marriage is tough stuff. It's a relatively modern dilemma
      you are facing with perhaps unrealistic expectations of what marriage "should"
      be. It sounds like your definitions of love and sexual passion have merged together,
      that's both common and confusing! Intimacy and sexuality within your marriage
      are bound to ebb and flow. Resparking your passion will involve growing. Using
      your sexual drama and fantasies as windows into discovering your needs (security)
      and wants (desires). Marriage is a people growing process; you mature into one
      another and to achieve fulfillment your continued development will be required.

      one else will be able to either. Try finding a small nugget of truth in the

  steps:
  - user: My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We've had some issues surrounding
      sex, particularly her lack of libido. She's on an anxiety medication, of which
      diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one
      of a lack of intimacy/romance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life
      has suffered as a result. Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she
      wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously
      fake orgasm I've ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told
      her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately
      enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I don't
      know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she
      will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to
      spiral further. Please help.

- story: How do I cope with "never being good enough?"
  steps:
  - user: I'm always told I'm not good enough or trying hard enough. I put 100% in
      to every thing. I'm worn out, I've worked on all of my family relationships,
      I'm doing great in school, I'm kind to those in need and otherwise. I stick
      to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so
      I don't have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from. Somehow it's still
      not good enough and nothing I do works. Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless.
      Any suggestions or ideas?
  - bot: Hello, and let me say first, what a great question!
  - bot: There are so many people putting forth their 100% everyday and often times,
      do not get the credit they deserve. Without being able to fully understand where
      you're question is coming from, I think there are a couple of different ways
      to look at this question.
  - bot: First, I think it's important for us to consider the message being sent by
      those in your life stating that you're "not good enough." Is that ACTUALLY what
      they said, or is this just what you heard? Sometimes, because of our own self-doubts
      and fears, we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others. Again,
      listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective. Is the message
      being sent coming from a place of love or concern? If so, have an honest and
      open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding
      the amount of energy and time you're spending on being "good enough." Explore
      with them how you feel you'r already giving your best.
  - bot: If the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have,
      then it may be time to explore the relationship. Some relationships we engage
      in can be toxic, especially if the other person is toxic. It may be they have
      their own "stuff" going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down
      to make themselves feel better. If you're in the direct path of this individual,
      then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire, as well. Explore
      whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life. If it's
      a relationship that MUST continue, then work on what you will do to distance
      yourself from their toxicity or their problems. Until they're willing to work
      on these issues for themselves, then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy,
      such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation.
  - bot: Another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why it's important
      for YOU to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals? NO ONE will
      ever be 100% "good enough" for EVERYONE. Every single person has their own set
      of expectations in themselves and expectations in others. It would be impossible
      to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives.
  - bot: The question becomes, what is it WITHIN you that feels the need to meet these
      expectations? There is most likely a part of you, yourself, as an individual
      that feels "less than" and feels as if you, yourself, are not good enough. It
      then becomes impossible to every feel "good enough" for others, because it's
      really YOU you're trying to feel good enough for. If you already feel as if
      you're doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself, then
      really work on LETTING GO of the rest. No one is perfect, and striving for perfection
      in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress. Find a middle ground in which
      you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals, and learn to let
      go of what's left. After all, tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more
      of your goals tomorrow!
  - bot: I recommend doing this by finding a mantra, a statement or phrase you can
      repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure
      from striving for perfection. The mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation
      you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of
      the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation. I leave you with one of
      my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra, "No one can make
      you feel inferior without your consent. " - Eleanor Roosevelt.

  - bot: The feeling of never feeling good enough usually stems from our early relationship
      with our parents or significant role models who made us to feel we were never
      good enough to meet their standards. In the healing process, you'll need to
      work on discovering the root source of where these thoughts and feelings come

  - bot: Hey, dogs are cool. They adore pleasing humans and often LOVE to work on
      learning what you want and expect from them. Your girlfriend on the other hand,
      likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours.
      You are good with dogs, that tells me that you've spent some time observing
      their behavior. The first step in working through this issue would be similar,
      start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often... Observation is
      a skill when it comes to relationship building. The skills you have mastered
      in relating with your dogs can carry over, you will just have to relearn what
      behaviors you are watching. And keep in mind that also means observing yourself
      in relationships.

      need to lie about. How do I figure out what triggers me to do this? And how
      do I help overcome this problem? I would like to become more honest and open
      no matter the situation.
  - bot: Well let's start with the awesome realization you've already had, you want
      to notice that you have triggers. That's huge. Really.
  - bot: I find that when people lie, it's most often as a defense mechanism. Which
      is likely a flag that something doesn't feel safe. What exactly doesn't feel
      safe could be lots of different things but the key to notice is that it's that
      feeling of insecurity that is very likely triggering you.
  - bot: It could really help to explore this with therapist, perhaps even someone
      with a trauma specialty -- that's not to say this is related to a trauma but
      more so to suggest that therapists specializing in trauma are very skilled at

  - bot: 'I recommend that you focus on the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs
      that are going through your mind at the time in which you are trying to approach
      a girl. When you are aware of the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs, you
      can then work on changing them. An easy way to recognize an irrational belief
      is a thought that contains the words "must or never." Once you recognize the
      thought or belief, I would like you to picture a big red stop sign. This is
      called thought stopping. This is a technique to use to stop unwanted or unhealthy
      thoughts. Then, I would like you to think of a more positive thought to replace
      it with such as: Negative thought: "That girl will never go out with me" STOP
      Positive thought: "I won''t know if she will go out with me unless I ask". What
      this does is increase your self confidence by replacing your negative thoughts
      with positive ones that will ultimately boost your self esteem.'

- story: Me and my girlfriend of 7 years are looking for some free couples counseling
    in Modesto, CA
  steps:
  - user: We have been fighting a lot and have 3 kids but we both want to stay together.
      I need some help to save our family.
  - bot: Hello, I do not live in the California area. However, perhaps I could make
      some suggestions as to where you might look for free counseling. First, I must
      mention that most insurances now cover for many different types of issues, including
      family issues. If your girlfriend lives with you, most insurances now cover
      "live-in partners," as well. If you have insurance, contact your policy provider
      and ask whether or not couples counseling is included.
  - bot: Aside from insurance, the next place that comes to mind is a religious affiliation.
      Do you belong to a church or other religious organization? Many of the pastors
      or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling, as
      well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling. These services are ordinarily
      offered free of charge to members.
  - bot: 'Another option might be to explore support groups within the area. There
      may be a group in the form of a couples support group that brings couples together
      to explore their relationships in the safety of the group. If you find there
      are no such groups in your area, there are anonymous, support groups online.
      Here is one such site: http://relationship.supportgroups.com/'

- story: My ex-boyfriend and I broke up about 3 months ago and now he wants me back
  steps:
  - user: I'm currently dating someone else and I really like him. But I love and
      miss my ex so much. What do I do?
  - bot: Finding the right person is a tricky thing to do. Why did you and your ex
      break up 3 months ago? In relationships with others you get to see a reflection
      of yourself. Sometimes you may enjoy that reflection, other times it may not
      feel so good. I'm not sure where you are in your life and relationships and
      what you do from here depends on what you desire more of in your life. But I'm
      not simply talking in the moment desire, I'm referring to the direction you
      want your life to go. If one of these guys was to support you...who would help
      you reach your dreams? And who would you enjoy spending time with? It's complicated
      and no one can answer the 'what to do' question but you. Slow down. Tune into
      your heart. Listen.

  steps:

      started after I got raped by my ex-boyfriend.
  - bot: I recommend that you seek professional services to address the trauma you
      experienced. EMDR has been proven to be very effective in treating trauma. In
      addition, a support group might be helpful to find a more stable support network.
      Either a support group for victims of rape or sex/love addiction
  - bot: www.sa.org

      most helpful.

- story: I cheated on my husband with one of his good friends a few years ago
  steps:
  - user: We kissed and he grabbed my boobs and we exchanged some texts and a few
      calls. It went on for about 8 months. Just when we were all together and our
      spouses were out of the room. Once I met him for lunch to tell him that we needed
      to stop. We ended up kissing after lunch and then I sent him a few more texts
      that day telling him I was serious and that was the end of it. His wife (my
      good friend) saw us kiss once and told my husband. I told him a couple of things
      then and we got over it. A year later she told him a couple of other things.
      Same story. It's been about 3 years since. They are now divorced and my husband
      and I have been happy. A few weeks ago the wife called me and said that her
      now ex told her more stuff we did. I decided to just tell my husband everything.
      We are trying to work things out. But he is having a really hard time believing
      that he knows all of it. How can I help him believe me?
  - bot: The issue at hand here is that you're betrayal broke his trust. In order
      to repair your relationship you will both need to
  - bot: confront the infidelity. And both of you will need to honor yourselves by
      communicating your feelings and ensuring that those feelings are heard and validated.
      It would be really helpful to do this work with a Gottman or Emotionally Focused
      Couples Therapist. Gottman's The Science of Trust and What Makes Love Last would
      both be helpful reference books to guide you along.

- story: About a year ago I found out my husband had cheated on me.
  steps:
  - user: Cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters
      I decided not to break up the family. However, now I am struggling to forget
      and forgive what happened. I feel like I cannot trust him. Without trust, I
      cannot stay in this relationship. On the other hand, I do not want my children
      to get hurt. I'm not sure how to move forward?
  - bot: 'Let''s just start with acknowledging that trust is huge and betrayal hurts.
      You''re entitled to your feelings; all of them and you need to know that your
      husband understands you. That said some ways are more effective at rebuilding
      and repairing relationships that others. I am a big fan of The Gottman Method
      for couples therapy, especially following infedienity. You can read about this
      approach in Gottman''s books: "The Science of Trust" and "Making Love Last"
      and/or you can seek a Gottman Certified couples therapist here: https://www.gottman.com/private-therapy/'

- story: I have come to the realization that my boyfriend and I want different things
  steps:
  - user: I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours
      away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per
      day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present
      and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and
      I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't
      continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that
      he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping
      me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years.
      The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of
      him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We
      have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to
      stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon
      separation always leads me to reconcile.
  - bot: Sounds like your panic is less about loosing the relationship you are in
      (which by the way doesn't sound like it's meeting YOUR need for connection)
      and more about being alone. Being with him is serving you, even if the relationship
      is less than ideal, from being alone. Being alone can be scary. You'd have to
      face yourself. You'd have to learn to love and care for and cherish yourself.
      All important skills and tasks in maturing and growing up, but scary none the
      less. What if...What if you gave yourself permission to be in a relationship
      with YOU?

    friend
  steps:
  - user: He goes out with her to dinner/brunch/movies when we are not together (we
      live 2 hours apart).
  - bot: Would you have the same desire to meet this friend if she were a he? If you
      are concerned that their friendship is a substitute for you when you aren't
      present,
  - bot: talk to him
  - bot: . It sounds like you are concerned that he is building an emotional intimacy
      with her and spending time doing the sort of things with her that you'd otherwise
      be doing with him. Help him understand why this bothers you but try to also
      be open to allowing him to make friends. Is the issue that he hasn't introduced
      you? Is there another reason you don't trust their friendship?

- story: Am I unworthy of being in a meaningful relationship?
  steps:
  - user: I'm in a relationship, but I feel like I'm always putting more into it and
      not getting reciprocated. My ex told me that I will never find anyone else,
      and that's lingering in the back of my mind.
  - bot: 'The most crucial key to any relationship is that mutual feeling you hold
      between you both: that you matter. Sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing
      your ex say you don''t matter. That''s why it didn''t work with him btw. He
      wasn''t reflecting to you that you mattered. However it ended, clearly though
      that''s the sentiment that''s lingering with you. So here you are hanging around
      a new man why is telling you the same message. Move on. You aren''t unworthy,
      you just haven''t found a man who is worthy of you!'
  - bot: To be worthy of you, he must see your worth. Often though before anyone else
      can see your worth, you have to believe it.

- story: I am fearful of social situations and avoiding people all together
  steps:
  - user: This is preventing me from getting a job. I have bad relationship with my
      bipolar mother. I am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around
      her that I have locked myself in my room. I have no friends or other family
      to help me. I have no money for therapy, but I think I need therapy before I
      can secure a job.
  - bot: A good first step would be to make an appointment with your primary care
      provider & discuss your concerns. They would have resources available to help
      in your particular situation.

- story: How can I train myself to stop eating when I'm full?
  steps:
  - user: I have no self control over food. Most people stop when they've had enough,
      but I keep eating for the pleasure of it. Especially with sweets - I'm never
      done eating dessert.
  - bot: Hello! I'm so glad you decided to write in today. This is such a great question
      and I'm sure many others will relate to exactly what you're describing. There
      are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern.
  - bot: First, I think it's important to understand food is just food. Food is meant
      to nourish our bodies, provide us with energy and yes, sometimes reserved for
      special occasions and celebrations. But in many cultures, we place a LOT of
      emphasis on food. We have food at every gathering and every celebration. What's
      more people have come to almost EXPECT food to be present at any and every get-together.
      And if it's not? Well, then forget about it!
  - bot: I see this time and time again with my clients. Donuts appear in the office,
      and it's almost like donuts have never been there before!
  - bot: Must eat one (or two)!
  - bot: However, we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence, or similar ones,
      will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food. It is likely the
      office donuts have happened before, and they will be there again on another
      day. During these moments, I like to have my clients employ a Stop-and-Think
      method. Stop-and-Think about your goals before you eat. Is this donut getting
      you where you want to be? Also, I have my clients ask themselves how special
      is this donut? If the donut really is a special donut (from the best bakery
      in town and you've never been there before) then now might be a time to have
      the donut. But if not, it would be wise to pass and wait until that "special"
      donut.
  - bot: Another aspect we need to remember about food, is to think about what we're
      getting from overindulging or overeating. Are you trying to drown out other
      emotions? Are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling
      for a brief moment? What ELSE is going on? This can be determined by utilizing
      what we describe as a Thought Record. A Thought Record involves tracking and
      identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers. By targeting
      the emotions, we can then determine where they're coming from, as well as how
      to decipher them. A therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions
      related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the Thought Record.
  - bot: The most important thing to remember is that "food addiction" can be a real
      problem for a lot of people. If food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied
      and overwhelmed with knowing where to start, please seek out help. Binge eating
      is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands.
  - bot: There are lots of free resources and information on my website at www.maddenwellnessky.com.
      In addition, I offer individual coaching and counseling through my website and
      I would love to help!

      but I keep eating for the pleasure of it. Especially with sweets - I'm never
      done eating dessert.
  - bot: I would recommend removing yourself from the environment you are in after
      you have finished eating. A simple walk around the block, calling up a friend
      and going to visit, or even going to another room in the house can help. If
      you find that you truly have no self control over food, I recommend attending
      Overeaters Anonymous; a 12 step group for those with compulsive issues related
      to food. I hope this helps.

- story: What can I communicate with a person who is sensitive to negativity in a
    disagreement?
  steps:
  - user: I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to
      a negative tone of voice. Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my
      communication is having a harmful impact on him. Once he believes I am being
      negative I can't seem to find a better way of communicating. In fact, it is
      often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably
      frustrating. What advice might you offer?
  - bot: 'With any type of criticism, it is usually best to introduce the topic at
      a neutral time, ie: when both of you are relaxed, with no current stressors
      involved, having fun, etc.'
  - bot: Begin with a non-judgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome
      event, as if it were just then crossing your mind (therefore not something you've
      been consumed with ruminating over - eases the impulse for him to dive straight
      into defense mode).
  - bot: Then share how you felt at the time of the event. Just say when.... I felt
      kind of hurt / shocked (or whatever the feeling was). PERIOD. THATS ALL YOU
      SHOULD SAY. Wait for him to respond to your matter-of-fact statement.
  - bot: No matter what his response is, stick to your same message - don't get overwhelmed
      by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for
      continued arguing. You can even add, "I agree I could have misunderstood it
      (event).... I just know it made me feel uneasy."
  - bot: Here you give him little wiggle room for a debate.
  - bot: Good luck & I'd love to hear how it goes!

- story: My new husband is constantly talking to himself.
  steps:
  - user: When I ask him who he is talking to, he tells me no one. But, it sounds
      like he is holding a conversation with someone. I have even accused him of having
      a secret cell phone. I ask so much, I feel like I am losing it. Is he trying
      to make me question my sanity, or is he talking to himself?
  - bot: A rare topic & likely extremely troublesome for you... I would need to have
      more background information on the two of you before
  - bot: beginning to offer any insight. Feel free to email me.
  - bot: I would also like to add that aside from the reality of whether or not these
      conversations are actually occurring, as your partner, he should be just as
      concerned about something that is disturbing you to this level. Partners need
      each others' trust and support, no matter who is right or wrong.
