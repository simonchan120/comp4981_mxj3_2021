stories:
- story: Please don't tell your talkative and energetic friends to shut up, stop talking,
    or ask them if they ever stop talking. You will inadvertently create an isolated,
    introverted, and insecure individual out of what once was a supernova of enthusiasm
    and character.
  steps:
  - user: Be kind and gentle.
  - bot: But what about the other way around? Friends heckling the quit one to talk
      more, be more enthusiastic! That made me never want to talk again
- story: Shout out to therapists who help us work through our shit while they're going
    through their own.
  steps:
  - user: I don't know how you do it, but thank you!
  - bot: Needed to read this before starting my week tomorrow. Convinced I'll lose
      it any moment and no longer be able to be there for my clients. Grateful for
      your post. Thank you.
- story: My therapist taught me this trick.
  steps:
  - user: 'When you feel anxious that someone is mad at you, doesn''t like you, or
      that things are worse than they actually are, ask yourself:  ‚ÄúWho told you that?‚Äù
      Typically you won''t have an answer and you''ll learn that it''s all in your
      head. Pass it on!'
  - bot: The wonders of Cognitive Behavioral therapy
- story: ‚ÄúPeople in therapy are often in therapy to deal with people in their life
    who won't go to therapy‚Äù
  steps:
  - user: Thought I'd share this because WEOW! saw this on IG, and it just hit hard
      because I didn't realize how much of this statement is so true
  - bot: In my first session, I told my therapist, "When parents don't go to therapy,
      their children have to."
- story: Once you realize you're a gift, you become very selective with who you offer
    your presence, spirit, love, and energy to. You are something to be cherished,
    not taken for granted.
  steps:
  - user: Read that again.
  - bot: How do I realize I'm a gift? Help.
- story: I love myself and NOBODY can take that away from me. That is MY power. Isn't
    that incredible? I hope you choose to love yourself today.
  steps:
  - user: Read that again. I hope you choose to love yourself today.
  - bot: I do not have anyone who loves me. Hope to get there because at the end of
      the day I only have myself.
- story: Two years from now, I'll be living a completely different life. Everything
    will be BETTER than it is now. Claiming it, working toward it, and that's how
    you achieve victory!ü§ûüèΩ‚ú®
  steps:
  - user: Upvote this. In 2 years when I repost it, let me know how far you've gone
      and what has happened since this post in 2020!
  - bot: '!remindme 2 years'
- story: Don't you hate it when you put up with abuse harassment bullying manipulation
    gaslighting and shit for too long and when you finally get angry everyone thinks
    you're crazy, jealous, drama, ... etc
  steps:
  - user: why are we shamed for normal emotions? and why we constantly have to block
      and ignore them?
  - bot: Yes. People get used to you being a pushover, and when you try to break out
      of that they get defensive because their paradigm begins to shift. The answer
      is not to get angry, but to be honest and direct, and to be willing to take
      the consequences for your relationships, come what may.
- story: My therapist wouldn't accept payment today.
  steps:
  - user: I told her about how tough it'll be on Christmas due to no money.  She wouldn't
      accept the payment today and said to buy my kids something.  I feel pathetic,
      but I cried and thanked her.  Honestly the nicest thing anybody has done for
      us in a long time.
  - bot: Therapy is often about accepting the things you push away. Accept that you
      are worthy and that someone wants to help. No one who goes to therapy and opens
      themselves up to change is ever pathetic, you are worthy and loved
- story: WHEN YOU SHOW UP TO FIRST DAY OF CLASSES AND YOUR PROFESSOR IS YOUR FORMER
    THERAPIST
  steps:
  - user: 'that is the postUpdate: now I need to make an introduction video as if
      they don''t know all my trauma lmaoooo'
  - bot: O no!!!This is definitely the professor 's responsibility to manage . Please
      don't drop until after a discussion about a possible resolution.
- story: 'Pro Tip: Establish dominance with your therapist, make them cry first.'
  steps:
  - user: I stole it from a facebook post, thought someone could use a laugh :)
  - bot: i have done that twice. it's a lot more uncomfortable than you might think.
- story: Therapists of sexually abused children‚Ä¶ I don't know how you do it. So very
    thankful for you to help my child.
  steps:
  - user: My child is getting back to her bubbly self. Slowly but surely she's going
      to be ok.
  - bot: Thank you for getting her the help she needs. Big hugs to you both.
- story: My friend is struggling to pay for therapy because she is out of work during
    the pandemic and the therapist offered therapy in return for a sexual favor. Should
    I report this to some board?
  steps:
  - user: Idk if it's my place since I'm not the one seeing this therapist.
  - bot: Ugh, is this therapist stupid? How is she supposed to continue her wellness
      journey after such an offer?
- story: My sister died this morning
  steps:
  - user: It was just me and her left. Now it's just me. I just had to tell someone.
  - bot: Sorry for your loss. And it is ok to vent here and reach out.
- story: 'My therapist: ‚Äúyou always use the mocking baby voice when you discuss a
    vulnerability of yours‚Äù'
  steps:
  - user: 'Damn I didn''t mean to be DRAGGED to the streets but #true Do you ever
      find yourself mocking your own struggles like shit'
  - bot: I love this haha. I definitely also try and minimize my issues in therapy
      sometimes. Sometimes that's the only way to get it out!
- story: I need therapy just from trying to find a therapist
  steps:
  - user: It's really discouraging putting all this effort into finding a therapist
      when therapists either don't accept my insurance, aren't accepting new clients,
      or aren't offering in-office sessions. Not to mention half of them not answering
      the phone. I'm feeling pretty defeated.
  - bot: '[removed]'
- story: I had sex with my therapist
  steps:
  - user: Im a 25m, my therapist who's like 30f convinced me to have sex during my
      session I feel alive but dirty at the same time. Depressed but happy how bad
      did I just fuck up?
  - bot: Wait..... DURING the session?
- story: Is it just me or do people need therapy because of the people who need therapy?
  steps:
  - user: Like their life is a mess and they have it bleed into yours, and then because
      of their behavior, you feel you need therapy yourself? It's like this never
      ending cycle (or so it seems).
  - bot: I've heard it said that the kids seek therapy because the parents never did.
- story: What my therapist told me
  steps:
  - user: Somebody needs to hear this.. and if you won't hear this from anyone else
      hear it out from meMy therapist told me ‚Äúsomeone who's emotionally unavailable
      can often make someone who's emotionally available feel like there basic needs
      are too much ‚Äú I honestly never forgot that.
  - bot: Someone emotionally unavailable did this to me and traumatized me to the
      point where I'm now the unavailable one. I felt so crushed BEGGING for the bare
      minimum that now I ask for nothing from nobody and want men To leave me alone.
      I can't even see myself dating again after it
- story: 'For anyone who needed to hear this: Self-love is accepting yourself, exactly
    as you are, in this very moment ‚ù§Ô∏è'
  steps:
  - user: From the ‚ÄúTen Percent Happier‚Äù podcast; Episode 309.
  - bot: '[deleted]'
- story: I'm learning to never defend myself against narcissists. They are professional
    victims and you will end up in a position where YOU are expected to apologize
    and reconcile with them. They refuse to take accountability yet YOU will be the
    bad guy for drawing boundaries.
  steps:
  - user: Know your power.
  - bot: I got a family full of em.
- story: My therapist said that I was very "boring".
  steps:
  - user: I talked to my therapist about my problems that I was facing and issues
      in high school. It felt horrible bringing it up. But then later in, he started
      to complain about this and said that I was very boring to listen to. It felt
      so rude and I didn't know what to do. Any advice?
  - bot: That's messed up. What type of therapist is this?
- story: Hey guys!!! I genuinely feel like I have full control of MY LIFE. My mental
    health is at an all time high 100%.
  steps:
  - user: I'm getting mentally stronger day by day. My boundaries are getting thicker
      and thicker. A WIN. üôåüèΩüíïüôèüèΩ
  - bot: That's great! Keep it up :) all the best for you
- story: I made a breakthrough in my therapy session today!!!
  steps:
  - user: That is all, just very excited and wanted to share üòä
  - bot: Good job ü§©ü§©ü•∞
- story: My too much for you was just enough for the right person. My too little to
    you was just enough for the right people. As I am, I am enough for the right people.
    So are you.
  steps:
  - user: Never feel like you are too much or too less, and do your best to stop outpouring
      every ounce of energy left for the wrong people.
  - bot: Thanks! I needed this today! I just came to the realization that a person
      I love dearly is incapable of actually loving me the way I need and deserve
      to be loved no matter what he claims to feel.
- story: My therapist always waits to take a sip when she thinks I'm not looking
  steps:
  - user: But I can always see it from the corner of my eye. No complaints here, just
      a funny observation. If any therapists are reading this, it's cool to just drink
      your water, coffee, whatever. Also, when we're looking away from the screen
      we can usually still register and decode movement.
  - bot: Lol thank you for saying this! I always feel a little weird because I don't
      want clients to think I'm just lounging at home chatting with them via telemedicine.
      What's funnier is that I have my own therapist and am never offended if she
      has a drink or snack.
- story: '*emailing my therapist*: haha! I had to take today off of work because I
    couldn''t stop having a panic attack long enough to take a shower or get dressed.
    Brain chemistry, amirite?! But I''d love to start seeing you weekly if you''re
    available. No pressure though. Just let me know!'
  steps:
  - user: Anyone else accidentally let slip their feeling of taking up too much space
      in their therapists life?I'll just go cry about how deeply rooted my insecurities
      are now that I've realized yet another.LOL AMIRITE!?!?!?!?!?!
  - bot: If it makes you feel better, yesterday I sent an email to my therapist explaining
      why I think I feel so attached to her and why I miss her between sessions and
      with possible solutions about this. I regretted sending the email immediately
      after pressing the send button. Now I am a ball of anxiety.
- story: Why is it so hard to open up in therapy about how you really feel? Instead
    I act like everything is fine when I'm really miserable in life.
  steps:
  - user: I don't get it
  - bot: Maybe its a feeling of being put on the spot, or like, its hard to be vulnerable
      with your therapist if you haven't warmed up to them yet?
- story: I've spent $29,750 on therapy.
  steps:
  - user: Just did some basic budgeting from my checking account. Over the last seven
      years I've paid therapists $29,750. My third biggest expenditure category after
      housing and food. Even more than I've spent on cars in those seven years.  Still
      don't even know what I'm supposed to do at therapy.
  - bot: I hate thinking about it. I spent 6k last year on therapy. When I think of
      it like that, it's like there's so much I'd rather do with that money!! But,
      working on myself HAS to be a priority. I have to believe it's worth it in the
      long run.
- story: Suicide bot
  steps:
  - user: Any chance the moderators could insert a suicide bot that posts National
      suicide hotline info any time the word suicide gets mentioned in a post?
  - bot: Interesting you ask this. I recently requested it on r/depression and they
      said they didn't like bots for the reason that alienation is one of the main
      causes of suicide, and if you immediately see someone has replied to your post
      but it's a bot you may be more likely to take your life.
- story: Today I told my therapist I missed him a lot and asked if he was disgusted
    by that...
  steps:
  - user: He said, NO Sigh. Relief. And yes. I come from a severely fucked up, abusive
      family. *Now no contact, thank christ. Assholes.*
  - bot: That's probably really normal and sounds like transference to me, which is
      also very normal.
- story: Shout out to therapists
  steps:
  - user: I spoke to mine just now (after a taking a few months off) and I feel like
      a new woman! Just wanted to show appreciation for therapists who are working
      through their own shit while always helping us with ours.
  - bot: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
- story: I finally found a therapist that I feel like understands me !!
  steps:
  - user: This post is to encourage people to change therapists if you don't think
      it's a good match. This is my 4th one, but  I can easily tell she takes my issues
      seriously. Gives me good example, explains the mechanism of brain. Keep finding
      and don't give up on therapy!
  - bot: Yay!
- story: Is it normal/ok to have imaginary conversations with my therapist as I go
    through my day?
  steps:
  - user: It's to the point where my internal dialogue is largely in his voice.
  - bot: This is not just normal, this is actually a good sign! This means you're
      engaged in your therapy! And that is great.
- story: Would you trust a therapist covered in tattoos?
  steps:
  - user: I'm currently studying to hopefully become a therapist someday. I already
      have some tattoos that can easily be covered up but I would like some more.
      However, I'm hesitant because of the career I want to go into. So I was wondering,
      would you trust a therapist with lots of tattoos?
  - bot: I am finishing my masters degree and marriage and family therapy and they
      tell us all the time we need therapist who represent all walks of life
- story: I'm tired of my family thinking therapy is like an emotional ATM that's going
    to magically going to fix me over night.
  steps:
  - user: I don't have enough energy right now to type out a rant, but the title says
      it all.
  - bot: Your parents might benefit from being reminded that you are working on overcoming/processing
      past experiences with them.
- story: Does having a complex about not being understood make you a better communicator,
    or does the complex drive you to become so distractingly specific about what you
    mean, that no one knows what you mean?
  steps:
  - user: Does anybody understand that?
  - bot: I realized that my desire to explain things really clearly and be understood
      made me appear defensive.  I have since worked really hard to correct that.
- story: I am so tired of therapists selecting every category under the sun for their
    ‚Äúspecialization‚Äù.
  steps:
  - user: Why can't I find a therapist who really focuses and has studied a few core
      issues. Why does every therapist just select every category available when creating
      online profiles. Is there anywhere left where I can find a therapist who is
      a specialist?
  - bot: This a huge problem in the OCD area. And therapists thinking meditation and
      yoga is the answer for everyone
- story: Home alone and I just managed to talk myself out of a panic attack
  steps:
  - user: Therapy is so worth it. I feel so strong. I'm so proud. That's all I wanted
      to say. Thanks for listening :)
  - bot: congrats im proud of you <3
- story: so...what does life feel like for a person who doesn't struggle with any
    mental illness?
  steps:
  - user: I literally feel like I'm faking everything and nothing really feels real....what
      does a typical day look like for a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person who doesn't struggle with
      mental illness? Are they like usually pretty motivated and balanced? lol I'm
      just trying to picture it to see if I'm faking everything :)))
  - bot: I'd answer but I'm not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù so wouldn't really know. I personally don't
      think it matters what's normal or not normal. I think it only matters if you're
      happy. Happy hugs (2 meters apart) xx
- story: What was the most helpful thing you heard in therapy?
  steps:
  - user: Or your most helpful therapy experience?
  - bot: '"Who made up that rule?"'
- story: I told me therapist I was racially harassed almost everyday in uni and he
    responded with ‚Äúbullying happens to everyone why is it effecting you of all people
    negatively‚Äù.
  steps:
  - user: I felt a little bit judged by his comment. I put up with harassment and
      bullying for years. Until I reached a point where I couldn't tolerate it anymore.
      I don't see how this indicates something is wrong with me.Toxic uni environment,
      hostility and hatred from classmates wasn't easy to deal with.
  - bot: Another person that absolutely should not be a therapist.
- story: I shut down at the sound of yelling
  steps:
  - user: Whenever I hear someone yelling even if it's not directed at me I break
      down, I start to hyperventilate and I end up crying or not being able to communicate
      with others for a bit after, what does this mean? and how can I stop this
  - bot: Do you have a trauma history/ adverse childhood experiences ? This sounds
      very much like a trauma reaction. If not I'd say it's being overwhelmed to the
      point of shutting down.
- story: Day 1, hour 0. Gotta start somewhere
  steps:
  - user: First session today and it went well. Proud to have taken the step . Cheers
      to y'all.
  - bot: Proud of you!
- story: HEY YOU!
  steps:
  - user: Everything is going to be alright, maybe not today, but eventually. Breathe
      easy and know that your day is coming.
  - bot: pulls out uno reverse card
- story: How can some people humiliate and hurt someone without guilt and for no other
    reason but their own unresolved trauma and issues.
  steps:
  - user: Even though I was abused for years and have anger toward my abusers I can't
      imagine treating someone the way I was treated. How do people do this shit without
      any guilt.
  - bot: I ask this almost every day. I was such a target for abuse in my family.
      And i just don't understand how they ever thought and think it's okay to treat
      a child or any human the way they did. And it's so frustrating to see them being
      normal with everyone else. It's very baffling
- story: Just wanted to recommend therapistaid.com
  steps:
  - user: I recently found the url above and it has helped me immensely and has all
      sorts of worksheets you can download. I have made a binder and go through it
      daily. Hope this info helps others.
  - bot: I love therapistaid! I use the "anger iceberg" quite frequently, especially
      with men who have a difficult time dealing with emotions.
- story: Why become a therapist if you don't actually want to help people?
  steps:
  - user: When I become one I'm going to do everything in my power to help people,
      not drain their bank account. If I could, I wouldn't charge them anything at
      all. This world is so messed up.
  - bot: It would be amazing if people could graduate without debt,  and then make
      a living wage helping others. This issue is systemic and not the fault of individual
      mental health professionals.  I promise this is not a field people go into for
      the money.
- story: I feel like I'm addicted to being depressed...like I don't want to be saved
    and I don't want to get better...has anyone else ever felt this way?
  steps:
  - user: I've been on 10mg lexapro for a month and have been kind of like a robot
      so I'm quitting it cold turkey today. I feel like part of me doesn't want to
      get better and doesn't want to feel happy. What the heck is going on.
  - bot: Yes! It's what I know...how I've lived for years. My therapist says it's
      because I'm more comfortable in chaos than normality (borderline) and that if
      things start to look ok and normal, I sabotage it.
- story: Therapist said her job is not to ask questions or provide guidance, but just
    to bear witness. Does that make any sense?
  steps:
  - user: This was her response when I said it would be helpful for me if she asked
      questions. I was surprised because if her job is just to listen, and provide
      no feedback, insight, or guidance, then why did I need a licensed therapist
      when I could have just journaled?
  - bot: As a therapist, asking questions is an absolutely vital part of my job. It
      sounds like your therapist might be doing something called "bad therapy."
- story: What separates good therapists from great therapists?
  steps:
  - user: Your views?
  - bot: I feel like great therapists walk a tightrope between validating their client's
      emotions/making them feel heard, and pushing back against distorted thought
      patterns that are likely part of the reason the client is in therapy.
- story: I found out my ex has talked to my therapist on a dating app.
  steps:
  - user: I still live with my ex in a very complicated situation. Last week, I found
      out that my ex and therapist have talked on a dating app. Obviously, I'm not
      even remotely comfortable with this. I asked my ex not to go there, but I'd
      also like to mention it to my therapist. Is this inappropriate?
  - bot: You should absolutely mention it.
- story: My therapist asked to reschedule because his mother died; I had planned to
    talk about my fear of my parents dying during my session‚Ä¶
  steps:
  - user: He's a really good therapist, but I'm afraid bringing up parents dying might
      be hard for him. Should I try a different therapist? Should I ask him about
      it before setting up an appointment?
  - bot: He's a professional; he should be able to make the distinction and might
      have some insights gained from his own experience
- story: Why is suicide illegal?
  steps:
  - user: If someone finds the cards they were dealt unacceptable why should they
      be forced to live a life unfulfillment and disappointment?
  - bot: I believe partly because it allows police or whoever to break in to help
      save the person. I read that somewhere but I could be wrong.
- story: why am i so obsessed with solving other peoples problems instead of my own?
  steps:
  - user: I will do whatever i can to help other people who are struggling, but the
      thought of helping myself makes me feel crazy anxious
  - bot: Maybe because it's a good distraction from your own problems.
- story: Would therapy benefit someone in the incel community?
  steps:
  - user: I am a part of the incel community and I have negative views on sex and
      women. I also have incredibly violent thoughts and bursts of anger which sometimes
      result in self harm. I don't really know if therapy is capable of helping or
      if it's just a nice idea with no real results. What do you think?
  - bot: I'm sure a therapist could help you sort through those thoughts and feelings.
- story: how do i talk to my therapist when i forget everything that happened throughout
    the week
  steps:
  - user: pretty much just that. i can never remember how i felt or why
  - bot: Keep a small notebook with you so you can jot things down as they come and
      then take it to your session.
- story: Therapist said "Welcome to adulthood" when I mentioned my issue. Am I over
    thinking or is this a red flag?
  steps:
  - user: Context when I said I felt I was left to do everything on my own in work
      she said this. I explained I get no help since I started new and this is all
      new to me.
  - bot: Maybe she's more of a ‚Äútough love‚Äù kind of person. Sometimes you have to
      find the right fit for you when it comes to therapy. There's nothing wrong with
      trying someone else!
- story: When was the last time you cried?
  steps:
  - user: Just curious I suppose.
  - bot: Lol, currently crying.
- story: I watched my pet pass away and it is haunting me.
  steps:
  - user: 'I don''t know what to doEdit: pet tax. Taj nicknamed in our family "Big
      Baby" https://i.imgur.com/ZqYg1Gx.jpg'
  - bot: Commemorate them. Do self care, reach out to your social circle. The world
      gets a bit darker when we lose the ones we love, but they would be here for
      us if they could.
- story: Has anyone wrote out what they were gonna share with their therapist before
    your session. Did it help?
  steps:
  - user: Has one anyone done this? I have something heavy on my mind that I wanna
      share with my therapist and it's something that I would like to work on as much
      as possible during my session.
  - bot: Yes it helps a lot. Sometimes it's difficult to get the words out and say
      what I need to so I just give them what's written and then we work through it.
      Right now, we have appointments via video calls because of lockdown, so I just
      usually email it to her 5 minutes before our call.
- story: Why do I associate most of the random noises I hear (without seeing where
    they are actually coming from) with acts of terrible violence?
  steps:
  - user: For example sounds from the street, neighbors etc...
  - bot: Omg I do the same thing. Every time I hear someone talk inside or outside
      my apartment building or when I hear random noises I always assume the worst
      and get very nervous... No idea why though :/
- story: ‚ÄúGod-given gift‚Äù
  steps:
  - user: 'My therapist suggested my highly sensitive nature is a result of my sexual
      trauma. Then, ya know what she says? She says this sensitivity is a ‚Äúblessing‚Äù
      and ‚Äúa god-given gift.‚Äù Absurd, no? Thanks for letting me grumble.Edit: this
      was session #2.'
  - bot: Does this mean that you are sensitive to the people around you and can "read
      the room" really well? Maybe the therapist was just trying to spin your struggle
      into a strength? And used prashing that was triggering?
- story: Have you ever protected someone's reputation by NOT telling your side of
    the story?
  steps:
  - user: Have you ever watched them humiliate you and play the victim to the public?
      That's another level of restraint/self control, but the reward is so much greater
      in the end! I'd rather stay blessed. It feels so much better than revenge!
  - bot: '[deleted]'
- story: So i just found out my psychiatrist has been charging my insurance an extra
    300 dollars for the same time and service each visit if i talked about anything
    other then my medication during my visit, so im being taxed extra anytime i ask
    how was you day or talk about mine? Is this normal or shady?
  steps:
  - user: Titles sums it up
  - bot: Depends. In the US, medical billing is different between insurance type.
      I was told I would need to book two appointments for two issues with the same
      doc.
- story: I find myself referring to me as we
  steps:
  - user: Like the title says I find when I'm alone and I think things I tend to use
      "we" instead of I, for example I'll think "we gotta get ready for work" or "we
      gotta get food", is this a problem? Sounds like a dumb question but I feel like
      I shouldn't be thinking that
  - bot: No it's not a problem bit confusing tho over text I imagine
- story: Idk who needed to hear this but..
  steps:
  - user: Your pain and suffering does not define you.
  - bot: Thank you.
- story: If I tell my therapist I was raped by my former teacher two years ago, and
    he is no longer in my life and is no longer teaching, will my therapist have to
    report it?
  steps:
  - user: I was a minor then, and I still am now. I live in IL, USA. I'd prefer if
      my parents didn't find out, and I absolutely cannot have any police involvement
  - bot: It varies from state to state. I would say most likely yes they'd have to
      report it since you are still a minor, and if he has any relationship with a
      child like parent/guardian/coach etc.I understand why you're hesitant and I
      hope you do find help.

      Please list some resources.

- story: Going back to therapy!!!
  steps:
  - user: Hi all! I finally contacted my old therapist after about 3 years.I went
      consistently throughout all of high school, but in college I semi-purposefully
      chose to stop going (yeah I know, big mistake).After 3 years I finally contacted
      her and set up a tele health appointment!
  - bot: '[deleted]'
- story: How do I tell my therapist I have suicidal thoughts without being sent to
    a phych ward?
  steps:
  - user: That's basically it.
  - bot: As a therapist clients tell me frequently about having suicidal thoughts.
      It only becomes a 911 call if they have an active plan with means (e.g. gun)
      and are set on following through.  Talk to your therapist!
- story: What will happen when I tell my therapist I was raped yesterday?
  steps:
  - user: I was raped yesterday and I called my therapist and asked for an extra appointment,
      I didn't tell her why. I have bipolar 1 and this has plummeted me into a really
      bad depression. Has anyone told their therapist they'd been raped right after
      it happened. I'm just very scared.
  - bot: I'm not sure but I think this is a very admirable way to move forward.  I'm
      so sorry you're in this situation.
- story: I'm afraid my brother will kill me.
  steps:
  - user: I think my brother sexually assaulted me when I was younger. He came on
      to me through text recently when he was drunk and may have admitted it. I don't
      want to see my immediate family anymore because I think he would shoot me.
  - bot: Is there someone safe you can talk with about this? Why do you think he will
      harm you?  Don't feel like you need to process this alone... reach out to someone
      for support.
- story: I am so tired but so grateful to be alive.
  steps:
  - user: That is all.
  - bot: Nice....Keep your chin up and stay strong
- story: using that gift $$
  steps:
  - user: 'All my relatives giving me cash to ‚Äúbuy yourself something nice‚Äù and I''m
      just like thanks for covering my therapy co-pays for the next month '
  - bot: This!!!
- story: Can I gift my therapist a plant?
  steps:
  - user: I propagate and grow succulents so it's not something I will have purchased
      for them, only taken from what I already have growing. Would it be okay to gift
      my therapist one of them? They seemed really happy for me when I told them about
      my hobby and I thought it would be a kind gesture.
  - bot: Some therapists have a blanket rule, so I do agree that you should ask first.
      But that sounds like a lovely gift!
- story: Does anyone else feel worse when they leave therapy? I'm just angry again
  steps:
  - user: I went to my walk in clinic because of a mental breakdown but nothing happened
      and I'm mad.
  - bot: Yeah, for sure. Some days I'd leave with clarity. Some days with a really
      raw feeling. Some days really tired and just wiped. Some days confused and no
      better off. So, yeah, for sure.
- story: Ive been able to sleep without having the blanket being pulled over my head!!
  steps:
  - user: Just realized and, really, it's the small changes that add up ü•∞
  - bot: oh yes, I remember doing that as well!you feel so free and comfortable once
      you stop doing it, so congrats, I'm very proud of you!
- story: Thanks for your time
  steps:
  - user: 'Therapist: what do we say to people we want to get to know?Me: Welcome
      to the shit show! Therapist: No "sigh"'
  - bot: That is totally what you say! Haha I'm kidding! ... mostly...
- story: I've decided to go to therapy last week and had my first Psych Evaluation
    today
  steps:
  - user: I finally had the courage to consult a therapist last week. Apparently,
      I've had unresolved trauma that started when i was 6 years old, and I'm 21 now.
      So that's like 15 years worth of trauma. I feel kinda scared but really proud
      of myself at the same time.
  - bot: I'm proud of you!
- story: how do i stop getting embarrassed when i try to talk to my therapist
  steps:
  - user: whenever i want to talk about whats in my head i get embarrassed and think
      im stupid and that i dont have problems worth her time
  - bot: Could it be that thinking that you are stupid and that you do not have problems
      worth her time, is a problem worth her time?
- story: This is the first time in a long time that I'm going to bed WANTING to wake
    up tomorrow.
  steps:
  - user: I couldn't have done it without my therapist. I'm so grateful to her.
  - bot: I'm very happy for you! ‚ÄãBe sure to tell your therapist that, too.
- story: What are three things that you are grateful for today?
  steps:
  - user: What made you smile? Even for a little bit
  - bot: It's 18c today and I'm so grateful for it. We've had hella hot summers here.
      (Australia)Really bad TikTok humourMy dog. Always.
- story: It's happening
  steps:
  - user: Today is the dayI'm going to therapy! I hope it goes wellI'm so nervous
      about this.Wish me luck guys, see you on the other side
  - bot: Good luck! First therapy for me tomorrow as well. Let us know how it goes
      (if you feel like sharing!)
- story: I saw a video of some person getting decapitated and I can't unsee it
  steps:
  - user: my brain In the middle of the nights like hey remember the time you saw
      this person being decapitated I'm like hey get outta my head tryna sleep
  - bot: Ugh, I am so so sorry you went through that. Graphic violence gets burned
      into my brain too, and over the years I've learned to avoid media like that
      just because I am sensitive to graphic material and it will replay in my head.
- story: signed up for a "covid pen pal" today
  steps:
  - user: Made me feel a little less alone. Thought you all might want to also. These
      days are long. covidpenpals(.)com
  - bot: 'Just signed up.What a lovely idea. Thank you for sharing. I''m excited.Update:
      I got my match today! I was getting some serious cabin fever this weekend and
      it was such a day brightener to have this in my inbox.'
- story: you you
  steps:
  - user: Good grief. After today's zoom appointment had technical difficulties and
      was carried out via phone, I now know I can cry using all mediums; face-to-face,
      zoom video, and phone call. I continue to amaze myself with my talents. üòä
  - bot: Hope you're doing okay and yes teletherapy these days works amazingly, just
      that you should be comfortable enough.
- story: Hang in there!
  steps:
  - user: This is for all those who are stuck at home during the pandemic with toxic
      families. More power to you to get through this tough time!Stay strong <3
  - bot: And for anyone stuck at home alone too, it can seem very depressing and lonely...
      but it isn't forever!
- story: Does anyone else
  steps:
  - user: Does anyone else recognize that they need therapy... but feel silly seeking
      it out because they have a mindset of ‚Äúit could be worse‚Äù or ‚Äúmy trauma is not
      as severe as others‚Äù so I'm unworthy/wasting the therapists time?
  - bot: 'Listening to a lecture on trauma I''ll always remember this sentence: Trauma
      can be like a baseball bat and trauma can be like sandpaper.'
- story: I am proud of myself
  steps:
  - user: Today I started the conversation with my therapist on something you been
      keeping secret for so so long. It was the hardest thing you ever had to say,
      but I did it. No idea what Im gonna do next session, but we will figure that
      out next week. For now, Im just proud of myself.
  - bot: I'm proud for you! You go you you!
- story: When do you know you should see a therapist?
  steps:
  - user: Does it show up on your day-to-day life or mentally/physically? I feel like
      I should see one but I'm not sure.
  - bot: When you start seriously asking that question. That's your brain telling
      you what it really needs.
- story: Is it possible this quarantine is good for mental health? I.e working on
    urself etc
  steps:
  - user: Pretty much just the title
  - bot: It depends on who you are. My clinic is doing tele-therapy right now and
      a lot of the clients are saying they're feeling down because they're locked
      up. But others claim they're doing fantastic and are enjoying the time away
      from society.
- story: An excerpt from today's therapy session
  steps:
  - user: 'Me: I don''t think I''m tramatized enough to have a disassociative disorder,
      it''s not like I''ve ever lost time or anythingMy therapist: Yes you do. Last
      week you said you lost an hour after work.Me: No way, I don''t remember that.Therapist:
      ....Me: ...Me: Oh dang'
  - bot: Gotcha!On a more serious note, happy for you that you have a therapist you
      trust and a good relationship with that person so these moments are possible.Way
      to go on healing! Or getting abducted by aliens for an hour, whichever it is.
      üíú
- story: Hello! to put it bluntly I hate women, what options are there for therapy/methods?
  steps:
  - user: Currently been to a therapist for about a month, made little progress as
      of right now though.
  - bot: A month is not a long time to have been in therapy. Don't expect instant
      results. Focus on any small insights and work on integrating them between sessions.
      Good luck!
- story: Therapist arrives 10 minutes late to session and ends 10 minutes early
  steps:
  - user: It's over video chat idk it's kind of annoying and it seems like shes always
      doing something during the session like looking at her computer or typing while
      were talking is that a bad sign?
  - bot: That's a sign that you are getting 20 minutes less of a session and that's
      bs. I'd find a new therapist.
- story: What creative ideas do you have to take care of your mental health? I want
    to turn off the flight/fight!
  steps:
  - user: I do all the obvious ones:therapy, diet, exercise, friendships...what else
      can I do?
  - bot: Delete social media. Get to the flow state as best as you can and practice
      doing it so you can get there more
- story: Anyone else feels that many people claim to be empathetic but they aren't
    as empathetic as they think they are.
  steps:
  - user: I'm wondering if there are limits to empathy. I met very judgmental, abusive
      people who talks about empathy and being understanding. I find it strange.
  - bot: Yeah two of the most manipulative, toxic people in my life have called themselves
      ‚Äúempaths‚Äù. I'm sure there's people who really are more empathetic than others
      but this makes me wary of people who use that label.
- story: Found out my therapist is anti-vax
  steps:
  - user: Like the title says. Honestly, it changes my opinion of her as a competent
      medical professional. I find it hard to respect anyone who thinks this about
      vaccines.Am I being irrational? I don't know. It just rubs me the wrong way.
  - bot: nope this would bother me too. different fields, same principle. speaks to
      their ability to think rationally about information presented, a worrying trait
      for a therapist to posses
- story: I'm so scared of how much other people hate.... Yet I'm the number one person
    who hates me.
  steps:
  - user: Does anyone else feel this way? Does anyone have suggestions on how to overcome
      this, or at least not feel that as much?
  - bot: I don't hate myself but I'm definitely harder on me than anyone else
- story: 'PSA:'
  steps:
  - user: Love isn't something you have to earn in order to deserve.
  - bot: I needed to see this today.  thank you <3
- story: Did therapy make a difference?
  steps:
  - user: Often on Reddit, everyone says ‚Äúget therapy‚Äù but who here has tried it and
      what are your experiences?I've tried it thrice and each time has been a waste
      of time.
  - bot: '[deleted]'
- story: Third session.
  steps:
  - user: Each session is better than the last. My session went very well and I'm
      feeling better after each one. Thank goodness. I wish all of you well.
  - bot: Was it hard to arrange your first one? Like on a personal level?
- story: Parents listened in on therapy
  steps:
  - user: I'm 16. I'll be 17 in April. Is it okay for my dad to hide in my bathroom
      behind the door to listen in to my therapy session? Am I irrational for being
      upset? We were just talking about medicine, but like I could've been talking
      about sa if he was there at a different time. I feel so violated.
  - bot: No. Not OK. That is definitely the farthest thing from OK.
- story: Therapists and politics
  steps:
  - user: When trying to find a therapist, is it acceptable to ask their political
      beliefs? Would the scheduler/receptionist be able to answer that question? It's
      important to me not to be paired with an alt-right Covid-denier. (And that's
      not up for debate with me.)
  - bot: I mean, you can ask anything. The therapist does not have to answer. A receptionist
      probably wouldn't be able to though. Might need to wait for the first session
- story: I always have so many thoughts that I want to share when we go to couples
    therapy, but I miss saying them in the emotion of it all. Does it look bad to
    make some notes on my phone and look at them while in the couples therapy session?
  steps:
  - user: Please give me your thoughts
  - bot: Write them down on a notepad.
- story: What are some ways I can be less sensitive and reactive? And take things
    less seriously?
  steps:
  - user: A big flaw of mine that affects my relationships is being sensitive and
      reactive. I frequently overthink and jump to negative conclusions. I'm looking
      for practices or literally anything to help me stop with this
  - bot: When I got like this it was because I just had so much unprocessed crap I
      had to take care of. Once I started processing stuff and got to a better place
      my emotions regulated out
- story: Hey you!
  steps:
  - user: Erase everything from the past that does not serve you and be grateful it
      brought you to this place now, to a new beginning. Breathe easy, everything
      is going to be okay.
  - bot: Wow, you make it sound so easy, who needs actual therapy...
- story: Jealous of those with family support
  steps:
  - user: Does anyone else feel this way? It comes out as bitterness towards some
      friends. It is bitterness but I'm just wondering if anyone else has this issue
      and we can discuss it.
  - bot: Me right here!!I've always been jealous, I had a very unstable family growing
      up, and still do. I get no support at all from them lol. Now my mom is sick
      with cancer and it's honestly just even worse.I've always been so jealous of
      my friends who have stable and supportive parents.
- story: Help i lost a fuck ton of money and i just found out my supervisors at work
    hate me
  steps:
  - user: I quit gambling about a year ago and i just started again 2 days ago. In
      a span of 2 days i've lost about a quarter of my life savings and I just found
      out my supervisors at work hate me. I really don't know what to do about myself.
  - bot: Yo don't. Put away the money in a fund where you can't touch it. Do it now.
- story: Couples counseling while doing individual therapy
  steps:
  - user: Is it doable? Or would it be too much? Looking for advice. I'm in individual
      therapy myself but my wife has suggested couples counseling moving forward in
      the next few months to sort out some things.
  - bot: I do both.  I haven't had problems except when it sometimes happens on the
      same day.  Can be a bit much but sometimes our schedules only work that way.  And
      often I can take what we've talked about in couples to my individual and break
      it down some more.  I'm all for it.
- story: I LOVEEEE DBT
  steps:
  - user: It's changing my life it's LIT ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I've never felt so happy or accomplished
      in myselfI'm so thankful for dbt :)
  - bot: dbt is truly life changing. i wish everyone could learn at least a little
      dbt, like its honestly so helpful
- story: I cannot commit to one thing for a long time. How can I change this?
  steps:
  - user: I have a habit of starting new things, working on it tirelessly for the
      first few months, and then leaving it and venturing into another thing. I have
      to stop this. But how?
  - bot: I have the same problem
- story: Amid the Covid-19 crisis

  - user: I'm a psychotherapist who recently started posting therapeutic memes on
      my IG @jourdantraverslcsw to help us get through the you you you're in the mood
      for feel good posts and some laughter, feel free to check-it-out! Wishing everyone
