- story: Keeping secrets from my family
  steps:
  - user: I have secrets in my mind, and I don't know what to do with them. I don't
      want to tell my wife and mom because I don't want to hurt them. But I'm not
      sure how long that I can keep the secret to myself. What should I do? It's becoming
      annoying and making me anxious. Help me out
  - bot: It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now. There
      are several things to consider before you make a decision.
  - bot: '- You mentioned that you don''t want your wife and mom to know because you
      don''t want to hurt them â€“ why would it hurt them?'
  - bot: '- Is it necessary for them to know this information?'
  - bot: '- What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling
      them? (for you and for your wife and mom).'
  - bot: '- Once you have considered these, think of what you would tell your friend
      if they were in your exact situation?'
  - bot: '- Also, if your wife or mom were in your situation right now, what do you
      think they would do themselves?'
  - bot: '- If your wife and mom were in this situation, how would you feel? Would
      you want to know the secrets?'
  - bot: '- How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health?'
  - bot: Once you have looked at the problem from all angles, you will be able to
      better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not.
