  steps:
  - user: Now I have anger and trust issues. How can I treat this and fix myself?

- story: How can I get people to listen?
  steps:

  - bot: I am very sorry to hear of your struggles. I think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce, especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years, so try not to be too hard on yourself. Take it one day at a time and do the best you can.

- story: How do I fix my marriage?
  steps:
  - user: My wife just last week said she wants a divorce and it's all sudden. I understand that marriages have their ups and downs but I don't understand why she can't tell me why she wants a divorce. Should I fight for my family (daughter and wife)?
  - bot: Chances are, if you really think about it, there were signs that something wasn’t quite right in your marriage. You may have passed these things off as being the normal ups and downs of a marriage, but whatever it was (or wasn't), it's obviously bothering your wife.

  steps:
  - user: I loved him more than anything. He passed away on our anniversary which was also the day I was going to apply for our apartment. I'm not handling it well. I moved to a new town and started a new life but nothing helps.

- story: How do I remember and deal with things I did as a kid?
  steps:
  - user: I did some horrible sexual things as a kid and I regret everything. Can someone help me cope with myself? Can someone help me remember my past?
  - bot: I'm very sorry to hear this. Hypnosis can be a valuable tool that a trained therapist can use to bring back suppressed memories. However, keep in mind that hypnosis doesn't work for everyone. I think regardless, speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would be beneficial.

  steps:
  - user: I have been with a guy for 4 years, he's a great guy and we also have a son together. The problem is that I'm in love with a guy that I've been talking to for about 2 years but I've never met him in person.

  steps:

  steps:
  - user: What do I do if I have been feeling like I could never be with anyone because no one would want me. Or I couldn't have many friends because of who I am. It's strange I want to be loved but I'd hate to be because I always lose.

  steps:
  - user: I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it. What should I do?

You’ve taken the first step to dealing with it. You can talk to your doctor, even if your depression isn’t related to your health.
- story: What can I do if my parents refuse to acknowledge my anxiety and self-confidence issues?
  steps:

I think this more because my friends say that if I was a girl I would be a hot looking one. And I don't care about having boobs or anything.

  - bot: Do you have a close friend or relative who's opinion you trust? Ask them for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does. If they don’t see these qualities in you, then it may be your cousin’s issue and she’s taking it out on you.

  - bot: It sounds like you are in a tough situation. You have to ask yourself why you don't want to leave her. Is it because of the child? Or is it because you want the relationship to work? You must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child.

  steps:
  - user: Or how to send him somewhere that can help him, something like The Baker Act.

- story: How do I get out of an abusive relationship?
  steps:
  - user: I've been with my boyfriend over 3 years. He cheated on me and the woman is now pregnant. He is physically and mentally abusive towards me. I have attempted to talk with him in order to resolve our issues; however, he never wants to talk and often blames me for everything.

- story: I'm in love with a sex offender, but my family doesn't accept him
  steps:
  - user: I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he didn't do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record since. I always believe the past should be left in past.

  steps:
  - user: About 3 years ago or so I was skinny, but I was still ugly. I really do want to change that but I've tried 3 times. Now can I try but don't stop. At school I get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and I have been bullied my whole life that I believe them.

  steps:
  - user: When having sex I think of other men and want other men all day long. Been married 3 years, together 14. What do you think?

  steps:
  - user: I'm in a relationship, but I feel like I'm always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated. My ex told me that I will never find anyone else, and that's lingering in the back of my mind.
  - bot: 'The most crucial key to any relationship is that mutual feeling you hold between you both: that you matter. Sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing your ex say you don''t matter. That''s why it didn''t work with him btw. He wasn''t reflecting to you that you mattered.'

- story: My new husband constantly talks to himself
  steps:
  - user: However, it seems as though he is really talking to someone other than himself. I have even accused him of having a secret phone. Is he trying to make me crazy on purpose, or is he really talking to himself?
  - bot: Some people simply talk to themselves as a way of processing information. Have you checked in with your husband about this in a non-accusatory way? Something like "Hey babe (or whatever sweet name you typically use), I'm so curious what that's all about? Do you notice that you are talking out loud?"
- story: I am in my mid-40s and am currently mending a broken heart over another failed relationship

- story: How do I find happiness after my boyfriend passed away?

  - bot: My first question for you would be to see if you've talked with her about it yet? You mentioned you found out....and I know this can be so painful. It can also be frightening to bring up the experience when it hurts a lot, when you feel so unsettled as you mention.
- story: My ex left without fully explaining but I feel broken and empty

  - bot: Sounds like you need closure. I'm sure your doing your best to overcome this feeling but seem to be struggling with your own happiness. Trust God no one else. Give this some time and don't close yourself off to the world or the people who love you. Be open hearted and minded.

While the nature of your obsession about the afterlife and eternity appear very powerful and unique to you, the pattern of obsessing about one thing/area is common.

  - bot: How much of your unhappiness with your boyfriend's way of handling himself regarding his ex, have you told him? The topics that upset you are the core of any intimate relationship. The good news is your own awareness of priorities and expectations from a partner.

  steps:
  - user: In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and we've been separated ever since. We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others. I stopped because I wanted my marriage to work out but he did not.

- story: I don't believe in myself anymore
  steps:
  - user: I was married to a narcissist sociopath for 10 years. During that time I was a general manager. I used to help him financially and in other ways when we were together. But things began to change. He emotionally and sexually drained me. I lost my spirit.

- story: How will I check if there really is something wrong with me?
  steps:
  - user: My boyfriend says I'm nuts. I need to get help because I get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me. Whenever I try to talk with him about it, he always turns it around on me by telling me what I'm doing wrong. I know that accusing him does not help.
  - bot: Trust your intuition that your boyfriend is involved with other people. You gave examples which strongly suggest this. Quite commonly, a person twist someone's words to convince then of having problems in seeing or understanding their own and other's behavior.
- story: Some adult family members are acting erratically in my house
  steps:
  - user: I am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home. They are peeing in cat litter boxes, bottles, and directly on floors and in corners of my house. Is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way? This is not a joke.
  - bot: Hi, This sounds like a very challenging and upsetting problem - good for you for reaching out! My first thought is, these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places.
- story: My husband is harsh towards our son and threatened me

  steps:
  - user: I am currently living in a hotel and I don’t have a family. I met a guy a month ago. He is a bisexual. He has a lot of gay friends on social networking sites. He would not help pay for the room. When I asked for the TV remote control, he threw it elsewhere and asked me to get it.
  - bot: I am less concerned about this man as bisexual and having gay friends, than about how you feel is treating you. You are in a vulnerable position because of social isolation. If you have friends to talk to, please reach out.

He can’t even come to visit my gynecologist. My mom goes to attend all of my doctor’s appointments. She’s supportive of me.
  - bot: You're not wrong for wanting to be with your boyfriend of three years who is also the biological father of your child. Do your parents object to you and your boyfriend continuing to see each other in person?

  - bot: Wonderful! I am so excited for you. What a huge decision. I am writing from Toronto Canada so it is hard for me to direct you specifically. I would start with two things 1) Find a doctor that is comfortable perscribing hormones and 2) find a Counsellor or Therapist that is transgender specialized.
- story: I want to have sexual experiences with adults, male or female
  steps:
  - user: How do I stop those thoughts?
  - bot: The thoughts you are having are just thoughts. Not actions. It is your choice whether you act on these thoughts.

- story: How can I determine if I should be a boy or girl?
  steps:
  - user: I feel like I would be more comfortable as a girl even though I still like girls. I think I'm like a girl stuck in a guy body. I imagine myself as a girl too. I think this more because my friends say that if I was a girl I would be a hot looking one. And I don't care about having boobs or anything.
  - bot: Gender is personal thing. There is not just boy and girl. It is ok to be a boy and feel feminine and date women. It is also ok to be a transgendered women and date women. Have fun with it and feel it out. What is right for you?
- story: How can I get people to listen?

  steps:
  - user: I been having anger problems a lot lately. It only takes one word wrongly said to set me off. I use to not be like this until I got with my soon-to-be husband. I think his mood and rage/anger problems have rubbed off on me a lot.
  - bot: My gut says that your own rage is being triggered partly because you feel trapped or shutdown by your fiance's moody/angry/rage responses and powerless to stop it. You can start by accepting that this is who he is and you won't change him.

  - bot: I'm sorry for the hurt you're feeling from your husband's decision. Keep in mind that if one partner does not want to be in a relationship and remains in it, then both people will be unhappy, dissatisfied and feel stressed. Imagine being in a relationship that you'd rather leave.

  steps:

  - bot: Hi, San Diego. I'm sad that this was your first experience (in 25 years) with feeling in love. You deserve better.

- story: I'm with someone, but I have unresolved feelings for my ex-boyfriend.
  steps:
  - user: Every once and a while, I think about my ex-boyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend. It’s like I can't get past it, and I need some kind of closure. I keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention. Nothing was ever wrong with it.

  steps:
  - user: Every time I speak, he says I anger him. Also, when he’s mad at something, like work, he gets angry at me. I feel like we’re so distant from each other now. We used to laugh all the time, and I feel like he lets too much negativity in. What should I do?
  - bot: Hi, Newark. It sounds to me like your husband is going through something, and I think you understand that. You might feel very helpless, sad, and disrespected at the same time. He's changed. It's unfair for him to blame you for his emotions.

  steps:
  - user: For the last year, my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting. I'm at my wits end. How can I get them to stop and get along?

  - bot: Hi Fort Worth, I applaud your awareness and insight into the relationship.

  steps:

  - bot: Hi Moore, Underneath all your anger is a lot of hurt. The hurt is there because you are being disrespected. Your boyfriend (unless you've only told me a small, disproportionate part of the bigger picture) doesn't tend to treat you like you're important and he dismisses your emotions.

  - user: I have a lot of issues going on right now. First of all, I have a lot of trouble sleeping at times, while other nights I sleep too much and still feel quite tired. I’m also noticing increased irritability and experiencing anxiety attacks that last for hours.
  - bot: It sounds like you are noticing yourself becoming overwhelmed with anxiety, feeling more irritable, and struggling to sleep consistently. There are many possibilities, in regards to what may be contributing to these things you are noticing, and a competent therapist may be able to help.
- story: Does my friend have depression?
  steps:
  - user: I am really worried about one of my friends because I think he has major depression. He disagrees with me on that. He is shut off when it comes to talking to people and telling them how he really feels. He told me he feels empty inside and the only emotions he feels are anger and sadness.
  - bot: First of all, I can tell that you really care about your friend and I think it's great that you are reaching out with your concern.
- story: I always feel depressed.
  steps:
  - user: I think about death all the time because I feel so alone. I want someone to love and someone to love me.
  - bot: Hi Ohio, I'm so glad you reached out. I urge you to talk to someone close to you, today, about your feelings, and to also seek professional help for your serious thoughts and feelings. We want you to be safe, and your depression is treatable.
- story: I'm desperate for attention, and I don't know what to do about it.
  steps:
  - user: I like getting attention from men. I don't have sex. I lead them on to thinking I might want to. I like to tease, I like for men to chase me, and I like to feel wanted.
  - bot: Hi Michigan, Good for you for recognising a destructive pattern. This behaviour, although it might get you the attention you want initially, will ultimately drive men away because it's not respectful of them. My gut says that you learned early on in life that your value is in your sexuality alone.
- story: How do I know if I have bipolar disorder?
  steps:
  - user: I feel that I am struggling with undiagnosed bipolar disorder, and it is making my day-to-day life extremely difficult.
  - bot: It sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of distress and you're wondering if it may meet a diagnosis of Bipolar disorder.
- story: Why do I feel like I’m watching my life from a window?
  steps:
  - user: I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.
  - bot: What you are describing sounds like it may be a form of dissociation. Dissociation is our mind's way of disconnecting us from aspects of our experience in an attempt to protect us in overwhelming situations. It also sounds like you are noticing anxiety in certain situations.
- story: I feel like I can't control having inappropriate thoughts.
  steps:
  - user: I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.
  - bot: It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate.
- story: I always feel depressed.
  steps:
  - user: I think about death all the time because I feel so alone. I want someone to love and someone to love me.
  - bot: Feeling alone and/or isolated is almost always associated with being depressed. As humans, we need connection and interaction with others in order to feel satisfied.
- story: My brother never hangs out with me anymore.
  steps:
  - user: I am a teenager, and my brother is a few years older. He has a girlfriend who is always with him. He never hangs out with me anymore. We were really close, and it is making me really sad.
  - bot: It is always hard when we feel as if we are losing somebody close to us. Feeling sad over these losses are normal. While there may be some things you can do to remedy this situation, it is important that you try and understand that part of life is change.
- story: My husband doesn't include me in the family.
  steps:
  - user: I've been hurt by a man for five years. He doesn't involve me with the family or kids. Everyone in the family is against me. There is a Mass today for a family member, and he never asked me to go. I'm to sit home alone now and Christmas too.
  - bot: Hi Florida, I get the sense that, aside from this relationship, you're quite isolated in general. It's sad that you're feeling excluded at Christmastime and family events.
- story: My wife is cheating and won’t tell me the truth.
  steps:
  - user: I found out today that my wife is cheating on me. I love her, but she won’t tell the truth even when I have proof. When I beg her to tell the truth, she yells, cusses, and gets a huge attitude.
  - bot: Hi Prattville, I'm sorry this is happening to you. You need support right now, and yes, you need answers. She is in denial and is trying to hide the truth, to protect herself. This is a natural behaviour. You don't indicate whether she wants the marriage, or is planning to leave.
- story: I have a compulsion to fill in holes in my skin with ink.
  steps:
  - user: I never get infections or scars or anything, and it doesn't bother me if it gets filled up with blood or something, but I'm concerned.
  - bot: Hi Houston, The fact that you're concerned says a lot. If I was your therapist I'd ask you questions about your worries and how this is causing a problem in your life. You're causing perhaps permanent changes (damage?) to your body, and it's likely you're trying to express something...pain maybe?
- story: Why do I feel like I’m watching my life from a window?
  steps:
  - user: I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.
  - bot: Hi Houston, Okay, something's definitely going on, right? My gut is to start with your family physician, because you have some physical symptoms.
- story: My brother never hangs out with me anymore.
  steps:
  - user: I am a teenager, and my brother is a few years older. He has a girlfriend who is always with him. He never hangs out with me anymore. We were really close, and it is making me really sad.
  - bot: Hi Zionsville. It's so sweet that you have a special relationship with your brother. You will ALWAYS have that, you know? He's doing what's natural at his age...spreading his wings and looking for love.
- story: I'm worried that I will be single forever.
  steps:
  - user: I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago.
  - bot: I think one of the first questions that springs to mind for me is, "what's the rush?" Just because other people in your circle have had experiences that you are still warming up to does not mean that there's something wrong or something to be ashamed of.
- story: How can I be happy again?
  steps:
  - user: At school, it feels like I've lost all my friends, and I've been really weird with my sleeping patterns. I used to cut myself, and I really want to again, but I change in the locker rooms because I don’t want anybody to see. I get ticked off easy and overreact.
  - bot: As silly as it may sound, making sure that we are getting the right amount of *restful* sleep is very important when we are feeling low.
- story: How do I become more confident and face social situations?
  steps:
  - user: For my whole life, I’ve been very unconfident, insecure, and self-questioning. I'm super quiet because I'm scared of what people will think of me. I avoid all social situations as it causes me great anxiety. It is how both of my parents have always been, and I feel like I'm doomed to that life also.
  - bot: One of the greatest ways that we can promote ourselves s by learning how to assert ourselves. Despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive, assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries.
- story: How can I be sure that I'm not choosing my relationship out of fear of being alone?
  steps:
  - user: I'm scared that I am with this man so I won't be alone. He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.
  - bot: While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think. Since you seem to care about your friend ("don't want to hurt him"), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together.
- story: How can I have a better relationship with my mom?
  steps:
  - user: My mom and I have been fighting a lot now, and I just want a good relationship with her.
  - bot: The best way to work on a relationship is for both people to engage with the problem and start communicating with each other more effectively.
- story: I'm worried that I will be single forever.
  steps:
  - user: I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago.
  - bot: It is very hard to want a loving relationship, and either see or imagine all around you, the great times other couples are having. Extra hard is that other people's comments may start giving you the sense that you are letting them down to not have a relationship!
- story: How can my boyfriend forgive me when I can't forgive myself?
  steps:
  - user: I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now. In the past, our relationship was difficult and frustrating. We argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work.
  - bot: Hi Cerritos, This is an interesting twist because it's more common for the person in your position to want to move forward, and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness.
- story: How do I cope or motivate myself without pain
  steps:
  - user: When I'm not cutting, I'm drinking. When I try healthy outlets such as exercise, I end up running myself down into an asthma attack. From weapons, to words, I can't help but self harm. What am I supposed to do, how do I stop this cycle? I don't know how else to cope or motivate myself without pain.
  - bot: It sounds like you are feeling helpless and out of control, you are concerned about your behavior, and at the same time you feel compelled to continue it.
- story: Why do I crave depression?
  steps:
  - user: It's not entirely true to say I enjoy being sad, but I always find a way to feel that way. I listen to sad music, read tragic stories, and, in a twisted way, like how bad it makes me feel. I focus on negative aspects of my life even if they aren't legitimate or I just make it seem negative.
  - bot: It sounds like you are noticing that you are drawn towards sad and negative content and it's hard to understand why. This may sound counter-intuitive, but sometimes we do things that on the surface may look problematic (or even cause us some real problems) because it serves us in some unseen way.
- story: Is my ex-boyfriend a pathological liar?
  steps:
  - user: I have an ex-boyfriend who just lies about everything. He is super lazy. He lies to everyone that he has a good job, builds trust, and then start borrowing money—and large amounts too. It has come to the point where he has gone through several group of friends.
  - bot: It sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your ex-boyfriend that are difficult to sort out. You notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him, and this is true of everyone to one degree or another.
- story: The love of my life wants to try getting back together with her child's father.
  steps:
  - user: About two and a half months ago, I met a woman on a dating site. We went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, I ended up at her house on a the Friday night one week after our first date.
  - bot: Love doesn't hurt. Your description of the relationship so far, is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain, alongside a deep attraction for this woman.
- story: I told my family doctor yesterday, that I am hoarding my Ativan pills. Is he legally required to tell my psychiatrist or therapist?
  steps:
  - user: I have major depression, severe, PTSD, anxiety disorder, and personality disorder. I had an appointment with my doctor. I was very upset, and I shared with him about that particular drug.
  - bot: Your doctor might be required to tell your psychiatrist - especially if your doctor is concerned about your safety. It was definitely a good thing that you told your primary care physician about what is going on. I know that must have been difficult to talk about with him.
- story: Can implanted thoughts be reversed at all?
  steps:
  - user: An organization admitted to implanting thoughts in my head with technologies. The study was to implant a fantasy other people are having, but to me, it's a nightmare. I lost my kids, my job, and all that. I was an unwilling participant. I no longer trust a therapist.
  - bot: Given your experience of being imposed upon against your will, and all the personal and professional loss that has come since, your fear of what will happen if you undergo treatment and trust a therapist is understandable.
- story: Should I let my boyfriend go?
  steps:
  - user: 'I''m an early 20 something year-old virgin, and my boyfriend is in his early 20s with kids. He''s cheated on me twice: once in the beginning and then four months ago. He wasn''t use to dating a virgin and broke up with me three times because he wasn''t sure.'
  - bot: Sorry to hear about all the stress in the relationship. You're on the right track by knowing and sticking with your own standards of what qualifies as acceptable behavior by your boyfriend. Since he was the one who broke your trust, he is one in the position of earning back your trust.
- story: Should I go back on my medicine?
  steps:
  - user: I have experienced cycles of depression for the past four years, and it hits me harder every time it comes back. This past time, it was extremely debilitating, so I went on Wellbutrin. I could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week.
  - bot: Deciding whether or not psychiatric medicine is a good option can be complicated, as you have noticed, and only a person who is licensed to prescribe can give you medical advice regarding medications.
- story: Can my marriage be saved?
  steps:
  - user: My husband and I have been together since high school. We have been married going on for nearly ten years, and we have three beautiful children. A few weeks ago, my husband decided he need some time apart and moved over to his dad’s for a while.
  - bot: While it would be impossible for me to say whether your marriage can be saved it sounds like you are both willing to give it a try and to get professional support. With appropriate professional support for your relationship a lot is possible.
- story: The love of my life wants to try getting back together with her child's father.
  steps:
  - user: About two and a half months ago, I met a woman on a dating site. We went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, I ended up at her house on a the Friday night one week after our first date.
  - bot: That sounds really heartbreaking. It is tough falling in love and not being able to dive fully because of complications on the other side. It sounds to me that you are doing exactly what you need to be doing by taking "care of myself" while the rest sorts itself out.
- story: I'm worried that I will be single forever.
  steps:
  - user: I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago.
  - bot: I think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries - myself included. Since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single.
- story: How can my boyfriend forgive me when I can't forgive myself?
  steps:
  - user: I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now. In the past, our relationship was difficult and frustrating. We argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work.
  - bot: So wonderful to have a boyfriend who is able to understand and forgive you. What do you think that he sees in you that allows him to do that? Does he see someone who like other humans makes mistakes?
- story: I'm worried that I will be single forever.
  steps:
  - user: I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago.
  - bot: Hi Winters, I'm so glad you wrote, because I think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing. You feel self-loathing for both being a virgin, and for being sexually active. Young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what they're supposed to be.
- story: Why am I constantly angry?
  steps:
  - user: I don't know what's with me. I'm almost constantly angry. Even when I'm happy, I still feel anger inside me. When I acknowledge it, it ruins my mood and takes over. I get angry at the littlest things. Even if I think someone said something they didn't, it infuriates me.
  - bot: Hi Nashville, I'm glad you want this to be different. It doesn't feel good to be angry all the time, and it's stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, I'm sure. Working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger.
- story: How am I supposed to feel when I forgive someone?
  steps:
  - user: My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.
  - bot: Hi Cleveland, I think I get what you're feeling. You're scared that if you forgive your mom, that would mean it wasn't so bad, or she'll think it's okay to do it again, or she won't realize how hurt you are. I invite you to look at forgiveness in a different way.
- story: Should I tell my kids that Santa is real after their dad told them he is not?
  steps:
  - user: My ex-husband told my two adolescents that Santa doesn't exist on the day before Christmas. They are desperate to hold on to the magic of Christmas, but I don't know if it's right for me to lie to them and tell them that Santa is real.
  - bot: Well Boise, the cat's out of the bag now, isn't it? I love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of Christmas. They must want that too if they still believe in Santa into their teen years, which is unusual, I believe. I wonder if they had already figured it out anyway?
- story: How do I get my guy to fall back in love with me?
  steps:
  - user: I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful. He has since had a rebound relationship. He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me. He says it's going to be too difficult to see me. Every time we talk, it feels like I'm being pushy to see him.
  - bot: Hi Kansas, I think your first instinct was good; you broke up with him. You deserve respect, but right now you're not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as he's moving on with a new relationship.
- story: How am I supposed to feel when I forgive someone?
  steps:
  - user: My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.
  - bot: How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.
- story: Do I leave my cheating husband or share him with someone?
  steps:
  - user: I've been with my husband for eight years now. We have split twice before, and the first time was because he cheated. I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes. However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust.
  - bot: Hi Jayuya, I'm struggling in this moment with my own biases. I have biases that are about respect and every individual's need for and right to respect. Your husband lies, cheats and physically hurts you. He makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same.
- story: My wife no longer wants sex.
  steps:
  - user: I crave attention, companionship, and sex. She has had a hysterectomy, and she has a bad knee.
  - bot: Hi Hampton, Although I'd bet your wife also wants the attention and companionship, it seems that there are a few barriers in your sexual relationship right now. I also would bet that there are things that your wife would like from you.
- story: Should I just move on from my demanding girlfriend?
  steps:
  - user: My girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years. We recently just broke up again last night on New Year’s Eve. When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened. She acts like everything is alright.
  - bot: Love is not enough to keep a relationship together. The people need to get along happily too. Let's start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partner. The frequent break ups happen for a reason. Try understanding more of why you go back together again.
- story: How do I manage my anger?
  steps:
  - user: I am so angry. I feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress, and I don't know what to do. I want to sit down with a psychologist, but I cannot afford one, nor do I have my own health insurance. I can feel myself starting to get violent.
  - bot: First off, it is great that you recognize that some changes need to be made. It is also really good that you understand where the source of your anxiety and stress comes from.
- story: How can I stop abusing alcohol?
  steps:
  - user: I have bipolar II disorder, I'm addicted to alcohol and weed, and I'm hopeless. I keep drinking even though it's harming myself and others.
  - bot: The first step to change is to admit that you have a problem that is in need of change. Frequently our problems keep us in denial. Although feeling hopeless is an uncomfortable feeling, it suggests to me that you know that you can not do this alone.
- story: Should I leave my boyfriend?
  steps:
  - user: My boyfriend has a child he gets every other weekend. He goes to see her twice a week or more. Every time she leaves, he gets into these funks like when his mom died.
  - bot: Hi Lockport, Building a relationship when there are already children involved is very tricky. You don't tell us whether you live together or not. If you do, your position is perhaps more difficult, because his daughter's behaviours affect you; you live in the home.
- story: How do I manage my anger?
  steps:
  - user: I am so angry. I feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress, and I don't know what to do. I want to sit down with a psychologist, but I cannot afford one, nor do I have my own health insurance. I can feel myself starting to get violent.
  - bot: I'm sorry you have so many arguments with your parents. Ideally parents are people who tolerate that their kids are people with their own unique characteristics. Everyone likes feeling loved by their parent. Do you feel loved even though you and them have clashes? Anger is a symptom of a problem.
- story: My child urinated in his mother's drink.
  steps:
  - user: Just wondering if this is a deviant act, and if I should be concerned for him. He isn’t quite 10.
  - bot: Well it's certainly unusual, and potentially could be cause for alarm. It's a passive aggressive act if done intentionally, so I would wonder if this child is trying to say something.
- story: How can I stop myself from making poor choices and hurting the one I love?
  steps:
  - user: I've been in a relationship for over a year. He's cheated and lied. I heard he's married, but he says he's not. Everything is very up and down; there's no trust.
  - bot: Hi Calgary (Canada! ), Let me get this straight...you're in a 'relationship', but he might be married. You both cheat and lie and he's abusive. The short answer is that there is too much wrong here for this therapist to try and fix it. Relationships don't heal us and they don't help us grow up.
- story: I can't leave my negative environment without leaving behind my fiancé.
  steps:
  - user: My fiancé and I have been in a relationship for two years. We have an infant son. My fiancé also has a child from a previous relationship. We do not live together. I live with my mother currently while I get on my feet, and he's living with some friends.
  - bot: Hi Bethlehem, You have a big decision to make. I appreciate your fiancé's need to stay close to his child and be a stand-up dad, and I am glad that you know your son needs an emotionally safe place.
- story: How do I open up to someone?
  steps:
  - user: Ever since my ex-boyfriend and I broke up, I can't seem to get close to anyone else. I know I'm completely over him, but I just can't break down my walls and let someone new into my life.
  - bot: Hi Bend, You're scared, right? That makes sense. Each time we have a break-up we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business. We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and there's a vulnerability in that; we can get hurt.
- story: How do I get my wife to forgive me?
  steps:
  - user: I didn't trust my wife when I found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling. I investigated him before I found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on. Now all my wife and I do is fight about trust.
  - bot: Hello. Being unable to trust your significant other certainly can cause one to feel unsettled. Has your spouse ever done anything questionable that would cause you to not trust her? If so, then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back. Couple's counseling would be of benefit.
- story: How can I get rid of my laziness?
  steps:
  - user: I am lazy. I am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time, but I never seem to shake the habits. I try to think of what it is doing to me and my future, but no matter what, I keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination.
  - bot: I am sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time. It sounds to me like you are suffering from depression to some degree. Have you seen a therapist or talked to anyone about your problems?
- story: My ex-boyfriend put himself on a dating website because he thought I wasn't interested.
  steps:
  - user: I have been seeing this guy for a little over a year. Back in August, he asked for us to step back for now. Since then, he has still been in contact with me every day. We spent some time together over the holidays, but then I was gone for New Years with family.
  - bot: It sounds like there is a bit of confusion regarding how you two feel about each other. Do you know what type of relationship you want with him? A friendship only, casual dating, or an exclusive relationship?
- story: How can I get rid of my laziness?
  steps:
  - user: I am lazy. I am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time, but I never seem to shake the habits. I try to think of what it is doing to me and my future, but no matter what, I keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination.
  - bot: Possibly laziness is not the true problem and is only what appears as the problem. Since you describe your laziness as an observable quality, I assume you've not always felt or handled yourself this way.
- story: How do I get my wife to forgive me?
  steps:
  - user: I didn't trust my wife when I found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling. I investigated him before I found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on. Now all my wife and I do is fight about trust.
  - bot: Instead of fighting about trust, is it possible for you and your wife to talk with other about areas which upset each of you? Whenever feelings are hurt, knowing what exactly is problematic and being heard and understood by the partner, goes a long way to building trust.
- story: I'm disgusted by my own fetish.
  steps:
  - user: I have an overwhelming desire to watch my wife have sex with another man. I talked to her about it, and she said she will do it for me. The idea excites me to no end, but I don’t want to because it disgusts me. How can I stop wanting it, or should I just give into it and do it?
  - bot: Try to understand your own ambivalence to having your wish fulfilled. Since you and your wife are in a relationship, the sex she will have with another man will affect emotions in both you and your wife.
- story: Why does the voice in my head never stop?
  steps:
  - user: From the moment I wake up, I hear what I think is my voice in my head. Even now, I hear it saying every word I’m thinking. When I lay down to sleep, I think of weird and crazy things, and the voice will never stop talking. I don’t know if it’s me thinking. It never stops.
  - bot: Does the voice in your head sound different or the same as your own voice when you talk to people and go about your usual daily life? There is a great big difference in the type of problem you're having if you feel the voice belongs to someone besides who you are.
- story: How to help my best friend get over a break up?
  steps:
  - user: I'm a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend. At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two.
  - bot: First off, I think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship, despite the fact that you have feelings for him. I think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things.
- story: I’ve been separated from my husband for six months and he still has not filed for divorce.
  steps:
  - user: My husband and I got into a huge dispute. He said he wanted a divorce, and I left. I still come home a lot and see my kids, and he has not filed yet even though he still said he is. What does that mean for our marriage?
  - bot: In situations like this, in most cases, he probably will not fill anytime soon. It's more of the fact that he isn't ready to give that life yet... Now if you probably pressured him about it then yes, he would probably give in..
- story: How can I deal with flashbacks of trauma?
  steps:
  - user: I was violently raped by another women who was my friend of 13 years. I’m having bad flashbacks. I’m scared to sleep because I see it in my dreams. I don't leave the house because I have panic attacks.
  - bot: I'm sorry for your suffering. There are therapy programs which help people to gradually feel more at ease so that daily living does not feel so frightening.
- story: How come I feel ugly?
  steps:
  - user: I'm in my early 20s. I’ve been married once, and he cheated on me. Ever since then, I've felt ugly no matter what. I'm engaged, and I still feel ugly. I don't like to take pictures of myself.
  - bot: Sounds as though you're taking the blame for the bad actions of your former husband. He did an ugly action, and instead of feeling only your own emotions in response to being cheated on, you are holding his ugly behavior within you and feeling it.
- story: Why does the voice in my head never stop?
  steps:
  - user: From the moment I wake up, I hear what I think is my voice in my head. Even now, I hear it saying every word I’m thinking. When I lay down to sleep, I think of weird and crazy things, and the voice will never stop talking. I don’t know if it’s me thinking. It never stops.
  - bot: First let's make sure that the voice is not one you hear outside your head and that it is not giving you commands. If either are the case, please visit a psychiatrist for an accurate assessment.
- story: I want to stop physically abusing my girlfriend.
  steps:
  - user: I have anger issues that have worsened over the years because I’ve never dealt with my emotions. My anger has never been expressed physically until the past year. My girlfriend has had to endure these episodes. I love her, and I think I’m about to lose her, if I already haven’t.
  - bot: Good for you for recognizing that a change has to be made quickly. Regardless of whether or not your girlfriend leaves your relationship, taking control of your anger needs to happen sooner than later. If left unresolved, it will follow you into any relationship you have.
- story: Should my step-daughters be told that their step-father has a child pornography addiction?
  steps:
  - user: My husband’s ex-wife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor. He, by his own admission, is addicted to child pornography. My step-daughters are now all teenagers. They do not know. My husband’s ex-wife has kept this information from my step-daughters.
  - bot: Lorain, you're correct that your husband's ex-wife is (seriously) minimizing this problem. I have a very strong opinion here. In my book, the safety of children trumps potentially insulting or hurting the feelings of adults. Of course the girls should be told, because they have the right to know.
- story: I want to stop physically abusing my girlfriend.
  steps:
  - user: I have anger issues that have worsened over the years because I’ve never dealt with my emotions. My anger has never been expressed physically until the past year. My girlfriend has had to endure these episodes. I love her, and I think I’m about to lose her, if I already haven’t.
  - bot: Hi Baton Rouge, I'm glad you're reaching out. The first step here is that you are taking some responsibility for your behaviours. I do hear you minimizing your actions (you say you don't "hit her enough to cause harm"? ), but you're headed in the right direction.
- story: I don't feel a connection to my husband anymore.
  steps:
  - user: I'm feeling different towards my husband. I feel I am growing from the relationship. I have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five. I just don't feel that connection anymore. I feel nothing. I don't know why or if I'm just being irrational.
  - bot: Lacey, I'm SO glad you wrote. Thousands of people are having this same feeling right now. I'm glad you're paying attention to it.
- story: Should my step-daughters be told that their step-father has a child pornography addiction?
  steps:
  - user: My husband’s ex-wife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor. He, by his own admission, is addicted to child pornography. My step-daughters are now all teenagers. They do not know. My husband’s ex-wife has kept this information from my step-daughters.
  - bot: If the daughters are old & mature enough to understand substance abuse. They should be told for their own empowerment. KNOWLEDGE is their power of safety and protection.
- story: Am I wrong because I don’t want to sit on the same couch my wife had sex with another man on while we were still married?
  steps:
  - user: I decided to stay and work it out. I just don’t want to sit on the couch. Other than that, I have been getting over the situation. I don't feel it is fair that she expects me to sit on that couch and won’t leave me alone about it. I can move on and continue to love, laugh, and play with my wife.
  - bot: Houston, It's normal for this kind of thing to be a trigger, so I get why you don't want to sit on it, but to keep refusing keeps the affair alive. Am I to assume that you can't afford a new one?
- story: How can I be less anxious when dealing with my toddler?
  steps:
  - user: My toddler defies everything I say and doesn’t see me as authoritative, so she says no about everything. I'd like to hear some ways I can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time.
  - bot: Hi Biddeford, This is a super goal. Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to; there's a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. Of course your toddler defies you, and that's healthy.
- story: Is it possible to gain joy and prosperity in my relationship after years of unhappiness?
  steps:
  - user: My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now. Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another.
  - bot: Hi Winters, I learned a long time ago that I can't ever predict who will change and who won't. I meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but can't make it work, and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change.
- story: How do I get my girlfriend back?
  steps:
  - user: My girlfriend broke up with me five months ago because I said awful things to her one night for no reason of hers. I have been trying to get her back, but it isn’t easy. She is in her 50s and I am in my 40s. She is the one I want for my life, and this is killing me.
  - bot: New York, what would it mean about you if you got her back? Is that the only way you can like or forgive yourself...if she forgives you and takes you back? Your self respect doesn't need to rely on this working with her.
- story: How do I find a therapist for my family as a minor?
  steps:
  - user: I’m a teenager. My entire family needs family therapy, and more than likely individual therapy. My parents refuse to take action, and I'm tired of it. Is there any way I can get out of this myself?
  - bot: This sounds like a really tough situation. As a teenager, you may be able to get counseling on your own (without needing your parents' consent) under some circumstances.
- story: Is my therapist telling my abuser the results of my test a HIPAA violation?
  steps:
  - user: After a domestic abuse situation, I went to a therapist, and then my husband went. The therapist discussed her assessment of borderline personality disorder with me. She then told my abuser the results of my tests.
  - bot: It sounds like it may have been a violation of confidentiality for your therapist to disclose information about you without your permission. There are some exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality however.
- story: Why do I hate sex?
  steps:
  - user: I love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex, but when it comes to the actual penetration, I hate it. I don't know why, but I just want it to be over. I feel like crying. I don't know why I don’t like it because all of my friends enjoy it.
  - bot: Although I am not entirely sure why you might be struggling in this area, an initial question I have is do you want to be sexually active at this time or is this something that you feel pressured into doing.?
- story: How can I be less anxious when dealing with my toddler?
  steps:
  - user: My toddler defies everything I say and doesn’t see me as authoritative, so she says no about everything. I'd like to hear some ways I can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time.
  - bot: That's a good question. I would say learn to pick your battles. What types of behavior/situations can you let go of? If you allow yourself to worry about the various areas in life that you cannot control, you will find yourself stressed out and unable to manage everything.
- story: Why do I hate sex?
  steps:
  - user: I love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex, but when it comes to the actual penetration, I hate it. I don't know why, but I just want it to be over. I feel like crying. I don't know why I don’t like it because all of my friends enjoy it.
  - bot: Does your boyfriend notice that you hate sex? If "yes", then it is a topic which the two of you would gain deeper understanding of each other, by discussing.
- story: How can I be less afraid of rape?
  steps:
  - user: Why am I so afraid of it? I don't understand.
  - bot: Your fear is somewhat reasonable. No one wants to be raped and I imagine everyone is afraid of what being raped would feel like. Do you mean that this fear is on your mind more often than you would like? If this is the case, then try understanding the reason behind your fear.
- story: Why do I feel so lonely these days?
  steps:
  - user: I have no idea what happened. I go places and do things but still feel lonely. I honestly have no friends, and I am always the one texting people and bothering people. I feel invisible, like someone that no one wants to be around.
  - bot: A lot of times any and each of us creates what we need for ourselves by seeing other people as creating these circumstances and situations.
- story: How can I be less anxious when dealing with my toddler?
  steps:
  - user: My toddler defies everything I say and doesn’t see me as authoritative, so she says no about everything. I'd like to hear some ways I can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time.
  - bot: Trust that you are a good mother and that you love your child. Trust and love are their own authority and come from a different inner place than the urge to be obeyed. Trust and love are effective guidance and usually feel happier and lighter too!
- story: Could a car accident add more problems to my posttraumatic stress disorder?
  steps:
  - user: I have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences. Not a year ago, I had a car accident. Could this experience add more problems?
  - bot: You are right on to recognize that the effects of trauma can be cumulative. It is very possible that a car accident could lead to an increase in PTSD symptoms that were related to other traumatic experiences.
- story: How can I control myself and learn to let things go or communicate?
  steps:
  - user: Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting. I say mean things to let my anger out.
  - bot: ' Taking accountability for your actions and seeking help is an excellent first step. I wonder where the anger is coming from. Learning what is at the root of it can shed some light on what the problem is and can provide some relief in itself.'
- story: How can I avoid having past traumatic experiences affect my present and future?
  steps:
  - user: I have family issues, and my dad was both violent and a cheater.
  - bot: I can imagine how incredibly difficult this must be for you. Having past traumatic experiences creap up on you without warning can be very scary and stressful. You may be suffering from symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder.
- story: How can I avoid having past traumatic experiences affect my present and future?
  steps:
  - user: I have family issues, and my dad was both violent and a cheater.
  - bot: Hi New York, There's no way to keep your past from affecting your present and future, because it's a huge part of who we are. The GOOD news is, though, that the effect doesn't have to be negative.
- story: Should my wife and I seek any kind of counseling if she is convinced our marriage is over and has turned romantic love into platonic love?
  steps:
  - user: Over the course of a few days, my wife was unsure about her feelings for me due to constant intimacy issues. After she thought things through, she came to the realization that she is no longer "in love" or attracted romantically to me.
  - bot: Hi Portland, This must feel like your world is turned upside down, for your wife to declare her confusion, followed closely by resignation, followed closely by a new "friend". I get how upsetting this is.
- story: Should I take my daughter to therapy?
  steps:
  - user: My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him.
  - bot: Hi Dillon, I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is "supervised".
- story: How do I help my partner overcome depression over not having his kids by his side all the time?
  steps:
  - user: My partner seems to always get depressed over the fact that his kids have to see and go through the divorce process. It’s especially when the mother of his kids keeps making him feel bad and using the kids as an excuse to get back at him.
  - bot: Hold on, Sanger! You know, I meet with a lot of people who are so sick of the crap that their ex puts them through in the divorce process that yes, they wonder if it's best to go back. I don't think so.
- story: How can I control myself and learn to let things go or communicate?
  steps:
  - user: Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting. I say mean things to let my anger out.
  - bot: Congratulations on making your way to Step One, self-observation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others. There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.

  steps:
  - user: I have family issues, and my dad was both violent and a cheater.
  - bot: Sorry that your growing up years in the family were so unsafe and painful. Everyone has family legacy patterns of behavior and ways of handling emotions, handed down to them simply by living.
- story: How can I like pets?
  steps:
  - user: My boyfriend recently got a kitty. I hate cats in general, and he knows it. It grosses me out and makes me very upset when he pets his cat. I want to throw out the cat. I feel very jealous.
  - bot: Sorry for you and sorry for the cat because you're each in a tense position. What was the context of your boyfriend adopting a cat since he was aware that this would likely cause problems in the relationship with you? If you don't already know his answer, then find out.
- story: Should I take my daughter to therapy?
  steps:
  - user: My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him.
  - bot: Has the father or the visitation supervisor contacted you regarding why your daughter hasn't shown up for the past three years' worth of supervised visitation? Or is the supervised visitation a new development for the bio dad and your daughter?
- story: How can I control myself and learn to let things go or communicate?
  steps:
  - user: Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting. I say mean things to let my anger out.
  - bot: Hi California, I'm happy to hear you want to get a hold of this problem. Relationships don't tend to last when we treat people poorly. It is very possible for you to learn different ways of relating, with some strong effort.
- story: I don't know what to do about my son's lying.
  steps:
  - user: My son stole my debit card and lied about it. It's not the first time he has lied. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should punish him or make him do something. I've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?
  - bot: Hi Enid, You sound like a sensitive parent; I like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong.
- story: I have feelings for one of my best friends.
  steps:
  - user: I was hanging out with my close guy friend. We started kissing, but afterwards, he said that we should just stay friends because he doesn't want to ruin anything. We both just got out of relationships. His was very sexual. I'm not a sexual person, and he knows that.
  - bot: Given that both you and your friend recently ended your respective romantic relationships, kissing each other sounds like each of you satisfied a very natural need which for right now does not has a natural source of satisfaction.
- story: How can I get over my ex-boyfriend cheating on me?
  steps:
  - user: It's been almost a year since my ex-boyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times. I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up.
  - bot: The dilemmas you present are giving you a great chance to understand your true reasons for being in a relationship. Continue developing some points you've written here.
- story: I'm depressed because my mother kicked me out after having a child.
  steps:
  - user: I just had a newborn. When I brought him home, my mom told me to leave. Now I'm in a women's home. I don't see my boyfriend that often because he works. The women's place is helping me find an apartment so I can go back to work and get child care.
  - bot: Congrats on the birth of your son! Was your mom's request for you to leave her house, one which she asked awhile ago or was this her greeting when you walked in the door?
- story: How do I fix my marriage?
  steps:
  - user: I have been married for 20 years. He and I both cheated. I hid my cheating for 14 years. Over that time, I let life stress me out. I became depressed. When I finally woke up, he felt I had pushed him out.
  - bot: Do you both want to fix the marriage? The relationship belongs to both of you so that one working without the other cooperating in this work too, will have one person who does all the changing. This dynamic itself creates problems of its own.
- story: Why do I still feel a connection with my ex-boyfriend that hurt me very badly?
  steps:
  - user: My ex-boyfriend boyfriend and I lived together. He had a two year affair with a girl and had three pregnancies with her. One was an abortion, another was a miscarriage, and then she had the third baby. They are not together, but he continues to contact me and wants me back. He has nothing to offer me.
  - bot: Hi Attica, This is a question I think a lot of people deal with...they feel confusion about why they can't forget about or get over (or stop connecting with) someone who they absolutely know isn't good for them. In your case, part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you.
- story: How can I stop being so emotional all the time over worthless stuff?
  steps:
  - user: I was never like this. Recently this year (my first year of high school), I started getting emotional for no reason.
  - bot: Hello Vancouver, It's really common for people to become very upset over small things sometimes. The small thing is a "trigger", and the emotions aren't so much about that event that's happening in the present; they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling.
- story: How can I control my anger?
  steps:
  - user: I have a really bad temper. I get mad very easily then stay like that the whole day. I don't mean to be that way, but I can't help it.
  - bot: A lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves.
- story: I found my boyfriend talking to his ex-girlfriend.
  steps:
  - user: About a month ago, I went through my boyfriend’s phone and found him messaging his ex-girlfriend that he was dating before me. He gave her a promise ring when they were together, and he still had it hiding in his memory box in our son’s room.
  - bot: Your sense of hurt is very understandable. Do you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each other's phones? I ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationship.
- story: Why do I think about death?
  steps:
  - user: I noticed lately that I've been thinking a lot about death. I don't want to die, and I'm not suicidal. I just think about what would happen if I died or if someone I loved died. I imagine how sad everyone I know would be. I know it isn't worth it, and I definitely want to live and have a future.
  - bot: I'll respond to your speculation that if you let go of the steering wheel while driving, you'll end up quite seriously hurt, at the very least. It is fine to play in your mind with "what ifs". People who write horror movie scripts most likely have some terrible sounding stories and suppositions.
- story: Why am I not as comfortable around my boyfriend anymore?
  steps:
  - user: I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately. I was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Lately, I've been questioning everything from my career to my relationship. My boyfriend and I just moved in a few months ago.
  - bot: Hi New Jersey, You talk about two very big changes in your life that have happened lately; the diagnosis/anxiety, and the moving in together. That's a lot! I love how you recognise that you been 'questioning everything'.
- story: My husband treats me terribly.
  steps:
  - user: 'My husband and I have been together for seven years now. I will be honest: I have a problem lying to him about stupid stuff. I recently stupidly lied to my husband about an accident because I was afraid to tell him what happened. Ever since then, he gives me the cold shoulder.'
  - bot: Hi Texas, Thanks for your honesty; it helps me know where to go in answering you. What strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtful/abusive/controlling with you, and then you ask "Should we call it quits?". We?
- story: How do I tell my parents that I'm depressed and need help?
  steps:
  - user: I'm depressed. I have been for years. I hide it from everyone because I'm scared of the reactions I'll get.
  - bot: Hi Georgia, There's a really good lesson here. People tell us things, and we tend to think that's the truth...but it's not! I'll do some translating for you... "You're so ungrateful" means "I need you to be successful and happy in order for me to feel I'm a good parent".
- story: My boyfriend wants me to sign a contract of things not to do.
  steps:
  - user: I was texting a guy who wasn't my boyfriend, and my boyfriend found out. We work together, so he went to work and told everyone I was cheating on him. I moved out of the house. There have been previous problems, and I feel like I'm usually the issue here.
  - bot: Hi Dallas, While I think it's healthy for both members of a couple to have things that they need from each other and to talk about that, your situation sounds one-sided and rigid. Will you have a list too?
- story: How can I help my daughter with her severe depression and her obsessive form of thinking?
  steps:
  - user: I am on my own with my daughter. I am so worried and stressed about her.
  - bot: Your instinct to help your daughter, is natural. How you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem, or if only you see this from observing her.
- story: How do I learn to feel emotion?
  steps:
  - user: I don't know how to have emotions. I never had any from my birth. Being human, I think of myself as a monster. I enjoy pain. I cut myself for my climax during sex. I think most of the time, I lie, even when sometimes it would have been easy just to tell the truth. I was in rehabilitation for four year.
  - bot: I'm not sure that you don't feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotions. From what you write, the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel. Little kids and babies don't remember whether or not they had emotions since birth.
- story: Why am I not as comfortable around my boyfriend anymore?
  steps:
  - user: I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately. I was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Lately, I've been questioning everything from my career to my relationship. My boyfriend and I just moved in a few months ago.
  - bot: How is your boyfriend responding to your discomfort around him? Has he told you that he's noticed changes in you? The good news about a relationship is that you can talk about matters with the other person. Doing so can only help clarify feelings and what either of you expect from the relationship.
- story: My mentally-ill mother-in-law wants to babysit.
  steps:
  - user: My mother-in-law is mentally ill. She has been for most of her life. She cuts herself. She has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for about 40 years. She has voices in her head that tell her to cut herself.
  - bot: Hi Fontana, Thanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question. It seems very clear to me that "no" would be the appropriate response. I like your healthy boundaries, and I'll help you explore possible ways to respond to her.
- story: How do I get my dad to understand that I don't want him to date or marry my best friend?
  steps:
  - user: I have known her for years. She was dating my brother-in-law when we met. My kids think of her as their aunt. On Halloween 2014, I lost my mom to cancer. My mom and dad were still married when she passed away. My friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis.
  - bot: How are you measuring whether or not your dad understands your wish? Your dad understanding your wish does not mean he will necessarily follow through with what you want.
- story: My wife doesn't want to have sex.
  steps:
  - user: My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives. We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesn't have the desire. She's also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her.
  - bot: Congrats on your upcoming baby! Its possible that the pregnancy is diminishing your wife's sex drive. From everything you describe about your wife, she sounds to not yet have become comfortable with having a wish for sex.
- story: I think I can become a transgender, but how can I be sure?
  steps:
  - user: I've recently thought that i could be transgender but I've never had the mind of a girl.
  - bot: Hello Frostproof, Thinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different. This is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in LGBTQ issues.
- story: I'm a mess physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.
  steps:
  - user: I'm in my late 50s. I never loved or have been loved. I need deeper help than is offered in my small town, but I cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia. I find myself losing hope more and more. My brain barely works anymore, and my memory so small, I forget in a moment. I serve no purpose.
  - bot: Hi Oak Harbor, My heart goes out to you. Sometimes when I'm working with a client who experiences depression or anxiety, I ask them for a glimpse into their worst moments in their minds. "What are the worst thoughts that run through your head?".
- story: How do I get my dad to understand that I don't want him to date or marry my best friend?
  steps:
  - user: I have known her for years. She was dating my brother-in-law when we met. My kids think of her as their aunt. On Halloween 2014, I lost my mom to cancer. My mom and dad were still married when she passed away. My friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis.
  - bot: Hi Lincoln, It can be very difficult for children who have lost a parent to then see their other parent moving forward with anyone, so I understand how this change is even more upsetting to you. And...your father and your friend have clearly established a friendship and fallen in love.
- story: My wife doesn't want to have sex.
  steps:
  - user: My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives. We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesn't have the desire. She's also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her.
  - bot: Hi Seattle, While it's normal in many relationships for there to be a difference in sex drives, I believe that your wife has a major barrier to having a healthy sexual relationship. I'd be curious about what it was like at the beginning for you both, but these things can change.
- story: How can I get over the past in my relationship?
  steps:
  - user: My boyfriend of five months expresses how much he cares for me and loves me, and I believe it. It has been one of the best relationships I have been in for a short period of time, but he has lied to me so much.
  - bot: New York, New York...it's not your boyfriend's lying that concerns me the most; it's the lies you tell yourself. Verbal expressions are easy, but it's walking the walk that's more important in the end. When someone shows you what they're capable of, you can believe them.
- story: How do I get over the man I had an affair with?
  steps:
  - user: We got into arguments, and we would break if off but start it back up again. We clicked, or so I thought. We are both married with problems in our marriage. We never have sex; we just send a lot of pictures back and forth and talk about doing things together.
  - bot: If you will "never be together" and in order to maintain this affair you need to deceive both of your spouses it seems unlikely that maintaining the affair will bring anything but heartbreak for everyone involved.
- story: What can I do if I need to talk to someone but I have no money?
  steps:
  - user: I am broke, but I am sure I have been depressed for the past couple of years. I have always had anxiety. I just need someone to talk to right now. I don't have any friends or family I can talk to. I'm on the verge of just giving up.
  - bot: 'Good question. There are resources out there - people to talk to. I''d try going to this link and calling the free 24/7 hotline: http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/'

  - bot: I wonder how long "anymore" will be for your boyfriend.
- story: How can I forgive myself?
  steps:
  - user: Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for. When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.
  - bot: Hi Ohio, I totally get how it can be more difficult to forgive ourselves than to forgive others. My guess is that you tend to come down too hard on yourself a lot. That's a huge barrier to happiness that you can work to reduce. I'll get you started.
- story: What should I do if I think my partner is cheating?
  steps:
  - user: How can I know if I'm just being paranoid?
  - bot: Hi Texas, Oh, that's a powerful idea, isn't it? It burrows into your head. Let's figure this out. First, has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? Have they cheated before? If not, then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence.
- story: My daughter calls me crazy, and I’m not sure how to handle that.
  steps:
  - user: I am divorced and happily remarried. Our blended family of children are in their 20s. My youngest, age 20, continues to call me crazy and favors her dad. He was abusive to me, and I left with injuries. He never wanted kids, and I did. He paid child support only through forced wage earners.
  - bot: It sounds really difficult to know that your daughter may be "choosing" her dad over you, perhaps I can help by saying her intense emotional reactions towards you actually acknowledge how much safer and connected she feels towards you. We tend to have big emotions around those we care for most.
- story: How can I stop abusing alcohol?
  steps:
  - user: I have bipolar II disorder, I'm addicted to alcohol and weed, and I'm hopeless. I keep drinking even though it's harming myself and others.
  - bot: This relationship with your step dad sounds very challenging. It is hard to to be told over and over again how not good enough we are. Let me offer you this, frequently when we say harsh, mean, nasty things to others, we are simply projecting our own thoughts about ourself.
- story: I have a tendency to not finish tasks I set my heart/mind to.
  steps:
  - user: I've been struggling with it for a test and I'm starting to believe it's something mental. What could it be?
  - bot: Hello in Jacksonville, It sounds like you are struggling with motivation to either take or study for a test. There could be several different causes. If you were being seen at my practice , I would ask you to describe your self-talk when engaging in these activities, during the different phases ie.

- story: How can I take my emotional support animal to school?
  steps:
  - user: I have severe anxiety and have tried everything. Everything makes it worst.The only thing that helps is my emotional support animal.
  - bot: Sorry to read of your suffering. Is it actually permitted that people are able to take support animals to school? I see your point of the animal helping you. I just also see the point that some people have allergies to animal hair or dander, or may feel distracted by an animal in the classroom.
- story: My husband was lying about drinking again.
  steps:
  - user: My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back.
  - bot: Hi Los Angeles, So your husband is giving you mixed messages. He says he's willing to cut back on the drinking, but he drinks and hides it. His behaviour is passive aggressive and immature, which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent.
- story: My daughter calls me crazy, and I’m not sure how to handle that.
  steps:
  - user: I am divorced and happily remarried. Our blended family of children are in their 20s. My youngest, age 20, continues to call me crazy and favors her dad. He was abusive to me, and I left with injuries. He never wanted kids, and I did. He paid child support only through forced wage earners.
  - bot: Hi Arkansas, Your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation. Your ex-partner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you. It's a form of woman abuse and child abuse.
- story: Why am I so angry and jealous?
  steps:
  - user: I'm in my late 20s, and I've never had a boyfriend or even been on a date. I have no friends. I hate Facebook because everyone else has kids and a great husband and great paying jobs. I work in retail, and I can't find a job. I have an Associate degree.
  - bot: In case knowing this helps you, there are many more people in similar circumstance as you than you may realize. Similar to you, they are not on FB for the reasons you list. Plus, no one wants to go on FB and tell the world they don't have a fantastic life.
- story: I need help with my severe claustrophobia, motorphobia, and anxiety.
  steps:
  - user: I've been having this ongoing problem for most of my life now. I am a young adult, and right now, driving and even being a passenger gives me terrible panic attacks and anxiety. I can't ride in the backseat or the front seat with the safety belt on.
  - bot: Not having support from your family for such a significant problem, is a problem itself. How about your friends, are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that you've got this problem?
- story: My husband was lying about drinking again.
  steps:
  - user: My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back.
  - bot: As exasperated as you feel, and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you, changing this is up to him. Does he care that you're upset with him for drinking more than he can handle? Does he care about you more than drinking?
- story: My father has always been horrible to me.
  steps:
  - user: My suppose-to-be father told me to go find my real dad. We haven't been getting along since I was a teenager. If I said one thing that he thought was wrong, I always got degraded. He never said “I love you.” He never gave us hugs. He’s always called me horrible names.
  - bot: Hi Louisiana, You got it right...he's "supposed to be" your father. It's tough enough being adopted (unless I'm reading it wrong, I think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you.
- story: Can a person be mean towards another person if that person was treated poorly before?
  steps:
  - user: I keep being mean to my best friend, and I don't know why all the time. I did come to maybe some kind of conclusion that it is because my mother is mean to me all the time. Could that be a cause?
  - bot: Hi Morristown, There's a saying that goes "hurt people hurt people". It's possible that your aggression towards your friends is connected to your mother's behaviours. When we are treated poorly, especially as children, it affects how we ourselves, others, and the world.
- story: I get so angry that I want to explode.
  steps:
  - user: I've got so much anger. I don't know how to control myself. My girlfriend screams at me all the time, and sometime I don't know how to deal with life. I'm very depressed and angry. I feel lost.
  - bot: Hi Campbell River, You say you have anger but you don't mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesn't. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if you're bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all.
- story: Is it wrong to be antisocial around people?
  steps:
  - user: I've been getting told lately by my partner that it’s embarrassing that I'm so antisocial around his family and friends. I believe it's because I'm not as social as him.
  - bot: Hi Buffalo, I think you're right; your partner's reactions are about him. I have to say it's a cruel thing to say to someone you love...that you're "embarrassed by them". The subtext says "You're not good enough", and I love that you can reject that false message.
- story: I'm worried that there's something wrong with the guy I love.
  steps:
  - user: I met a guy a while ago, and I can't stop thinking about him. I feel like I love him, but I don't think I know him. What if he is not who I think he is? I cry sometimes thinking someone is going to be with him or that he has a girlfriend. I don't know, am I too obsessive?
  - bot: Keller, it sounds like you're living this relationship in your mind, instead of in the real world. You can get answers to your questions by talking to him...getting to know him will answer all the curiosities you have. You're asking the questions in your head instead of being in the friendship.
- story: I'm depressed and unable to connect with people after my breakup.
  steps:
  - user: A girl and I were madly in love. We dated for over a year and were even talking about marriage and future plans together. She moved away for school, and we attempted a long distance relationship. We eventually broke up. It's been a year now, and I still haven't lost my feelings for her.
  - bot: Hi Boise, I'm sorry that you've lost this love. The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time. It's different now...you're not together anymore, but you can't accept this, right?
- story: How do I learn to let go of past problems and live one day at a time?
  steps:
  - user: I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.

- story: I have voices in my head.
  steps:
  - user: They don't go away, and I feel like I'm going crazy. Does that ever stop? Can it be a symptom of medication?

- story: How do I learn to let go of past problems and live one day at a time?
  steps:
  - user: I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.
  - bot: Remember, the past no longer exists and the future is just an illusion as we don't know what will happen tomorrow, so take the present as your guide. That is all we can do, so keep saying this to yourself and try to help someone each day. The happiness is helping others to feel a bit better.
- story: Am I a lesbian because I love a girl?
  steps:
  - user: I’m in love with my friend who is also a girl. I fell in love with her in a few months. That was my first love. We used to talk for the whole day and night over the phone and on Facebook. I thought she had the same feelings for me, but I was wrong.
  - bot: It all depends how old you are and what a particular situation is. You may be feeling very close to this friend and mistake that feeling for sexual feeling, or the feelings may be real.
- story: I have voices in my head.
  steps:
  - user: They don't go away, and I feel like I'm going crazy. Does that ever stop? Can it be a symptom of medication?
  - bot: Since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you, then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you are.
- story: i need answers to my angry, possessiveness, and urges
  steps:
  - user: I need answers to my anger, possessiveness, and urges. I am angry all the time. I push people away so much that I actually blow up on people now because they ask me how my day is or was. I have a possessiveness to someone who is not even mine. I have these urges to hurt someone really bad.
  - bot: What result are you hoping to get from the behaviors you describe? Maybe start by comparing the results you see yourself receiving from your current interactions, with how you would wish to feel from relating to others. Since you ask, "what is wrong with me?
- story: How do I learn to let go of past problems and live one day at a time?
  steps:
  - user: I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.
  - bot: Would you describe yourself as sensitive to your surroundings and emotions? If yes, this may explain why letting go of past problems, is itself a problem. The dynamic of living one day at a time and letting go of past problems, is more imaginary and wishful than real.
- story: How can I get my fiancé to notice me again?
  steps:
  - user: My fiancé and I have almost the best relationship every girl wants, but lately it's changed. I get less attention and little to no intercourse. He works a lot and goes to the gym a lot (he's a football player for an indoor league), but he has no time for me.
  - bot: Your situation sounds a little painful. Have you brought up any of these topics for discussion with your fiancé? Now is a good time for finding out if and how your future husband is interested and addresses the way you are feeling.
- story: I think I have anxiety and depression. It has manifested an extreme distrust for others.
  steps:
  - user: My husband and I are in a terrible place. Part of me wants to fix it, but then I'm caught up with not knowing how and not being able to communicate my feelings to him because he always feels I'm blaming him. Sometimes I am because the feelings of distrust are so strong.
  - bot: You may be pressuring yourself to be the one person who fixes the relationship. This is impossible because the relationship belongs to both of you. Has he told you whether he feels about himself that how he interacts with you, is contributing to problems in the couple?
- story: How do you get over someone cheating on you when you are trying to make it work?
  steps:
  - user: My boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. We've since gotten back together and are trying to make it work. I don't know how to trust him now, but I really want to make it work, and it seems like he does too.
  - bot: Hi Michigan, This is a common issue. How do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you? I totally get that it's hard, and I believe it's worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone. You can be stronger in the scarred places.

  steps:
  - user: I have been married for ten years. My husband is 29 years my senior. We have a young daughter. Ever since she was born, my husband has "shut down." We have no intimacy; he doesn't even kiss me.
  - bot: Hi Smyrna, Your husband is avoiding dealing with this problem. I understand how lonely you must feel, not only sexually, but emotionally too. From what you describe, it seems that he wants to be there for you, but he clearly has barriers to engaging fully around this issue.
- story: My daughter calls me crazy, and I’m not sure how to handle that.
  steps:
  - user: I am divorced and happily remarried. Our blended family of children are in their 20s. My youngest, age 20, continues to call me crazy and favors her dad. He was abusive to me, and I left with injuries. He never wanted kids, and I did. He paid child support only through forced wage earners.
  - bot: Hi, I understand what you're going through. Your daughters favor him because he has done no wrong in their eyes. Im guessing they lived with you? Growing up I was the same way.. I favoured my dad, thinking he has done no wrong. He also abused my mother multiple times, and that never came to mind.
- story: Why do I throw all my stuff away?
  steps:
  - user: I constantly have this urge to throw away all my stuff. It’s constantly on my mind and makes me feel anxious. I don’t sleep because I’m thinking about something I can get rid of. I don’t know why I do it. I started years ago when I lived with my dad then I stopped when I moved in with my mom.
  - bot: Since you wrote that you noticed a change in your throwing away urge when you changed with which parent you lived, would you feel that throwing away things is connected to wanting to be done with certain areas of influence with either parent?
- story: I need to know how to cope with misophonia before I go completely insane.

  - bot: Hi Brentwood, While our society tends to want to put us into categories...slots...when it comes to sexuality, because this is nice and neat and convenient...many people find that they don't fit perfectly into one or the other.
- story: I'm a teenager, and I want to have a baby with my boyfriend.
  steps:
  - user: I have been dating my boyfriend for a month, and we want a baby. We don't work or drive, and we haven't talked to our parents. What should we do?
  - bot: Hi Athens, When a teenager wants to have a baby, it's usually for a specific, and not healthy, reason. Do you maybe hope that a baby will cement your relationship? It doesn't work that way. Do you yearn for a person who will love you deeply? Babies don't give to us; we give endlessly to them.
- story: How do I get over my fears of dying?
  steps:
  - user: Recently, I had a close call after delivering my second child (blood clot followed by internal bleeding and several blood transfusions). It was a close call. I am currently undergoing medical treatment because of the event, and I am constantly afraid the whole ordeal will happen again.
  - bot: Hi Meriden, it's natural that after a serious scare like that you would have some anxiety and fear. This fear is helpful to some extent, because it will assist you in taking care of yourself and not taking unnecessary risks with your health.
- story: My brother's ex-girlfriend doesn't want her son to see us anymore.
  steps:
  - user: My brother just broke up with his girlfriend. While they were dating for the past two years, her son spent the weekends with me and my mother. Now she doesn't think her son should have any interaction with us. How should we approach the situation? Is she doing the right thing for her child?

- story: I'm questioning my sexuality.
  steps:
  - user: I'm a teenage girl. I don't know if I'm straight, bisexual, or gay. I've been straight all my life, but a sudden rush of questions have come over me, and I don't know anymore.
  - bot: Being open minded about the type of sexual connection which feels true and real, is a solid starting point. Having questions is a very valuable way of more clearly defining your sexuality.
- story: How do I know if I have depression?
  steps:
  - user: I'm almost never happy. Half of the time, I don't feel anything. I find it easy to make myself feel nothing. I know I push people away because it’s easier. I just want answers. I'm sick of feeling this way. It’s ruining my relationships with people.
  - bot: Hi Loyal, This is a common question. I suggest that you not diagnose yourself (only a physician can do that), but the symptoms you mention are certainly common signs of depression; rarely happy, emotional numbness, hopelessness, isolation. Depression is very common.

  steps:
  - user: She is living with her boyfriend of seven years. He is in therapy for depression and social anxiety. He hasn't worked in all this time.
  - bot: Hi New York, There is no need for shame here; no one's done anything wrong! A pregnancy is a glorious gift to be celebrated. I wonder what gets in the way of you celebrating your daughter's pregnancy? Are they excited about it? I bet they are. They've been together for seven years.
- story: How do I get rid of depression?
  steps:
  - user: I've been feeling worthless, unaccomplished, and so frustrated. I want to break things, hit myself, run away, kick, scream, and cry. I just want to be happy and outgoing again. I want to be able to take care of my daughter and live comfortably.
  - bot: Philadelphia, there is help out there. For your daughter's sake, start somewhere. Feelings are only that; your worst fears about who you are are only based on a few moments that haven't gone well. Depression is so treatable, but you have to seek treatment from a professional.
- story: How do I better handle my breakup?
  steps:
  - user: I got involved with my best friend who is married but has been very unhappy for the last five years. We both fell in love and have been together for eight months. He left the house and filed for divorce. He decided to tell her about our relationship, and she is willing to forgive and work on things.
  - bot: Hi Miami, I feel your sadness; you might have planned a future with your best friend. We live in a world where we are constantly exposed and connected to people who intrigue us and to whom we might feel a connection.

  steps:
  - user: I think I'm annoying and bothersome, but my girlfriend says I'm just fine. I don't think so, I think I'm stressing everyone else out
  - bot: I'm glad to hear you have friends and that your friends say they like you. Trust your own sense of who you are which tells you that something feels uneasy within yourself. Is the friend who says you're "just fine", very familiar with who you are? "Friend" is a broad category.

- story: Do I have social anxiety?
  steps:

- story: My boyfriend is always accusing me of not loving him.
  steps:
  - user: I love him so much, and I don't know what to do.

- story: My boyfriend says he doesn't like to do things with me because we fight too much.
  steps:
  - user: He owns his own business. Sometimes, he stays out all night but doesn't tell me. We have a son together, and I get to stay home with him. He says I complain too much about what he's doing. We've been together a year and a half. I got pregnant after being together for a month.
  - bot: Hi Oklahoma, Listen to him when he says this is how he is. Your boyfriend's behaviours are about him; not you. At the start of a relationship it's easy to be loving and attentive; but it takes years to really get to know someone deeply. With time, people reveal who they are.
- story: I’m afraid that I’m gay.
  steps:
  - user: I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust.
  - bot: Hi Brookfield, It can be unsettling when we feel something as fundamental as our sexual orientation shifting. I like that you're honest enough with yourself to say "I'm struggling with this". To accept that there is a question is a brave place to be. And...it doesn't necessarily mean you're gay.
- story: My boyfriend says he doesn't like to do things with me because we fight too much.

  steps:
  - user: I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me.

- story: How can I deal with my paranoia?
  steps:
  - user: I'm a little paranoid. My mind does get the best of me. One night, I put chairs under all of my door knobs because I thought someone might break in. I also think a lot, which is probably the reason for the paranoia. I can't stand loud noises, like the sound of cars going by.
  - bot: Paranoid people don't realize they are paranoid. They believe their actions to be reasonable responses to potential threats. From what you write, you are aware that your actions may be understood as extreme.
- story: My boyfriend is always accusing me of not loving him.

  steps:
  - user: He is verbally abusive. When he gets mad, he just yells at me. At times, I feel scared.

Marriage is based in love and feeling taken care of by the partner. Feeling scared is the opposite of this.
- story: Am I somehow stressing myself out?
  steps:
  - user: I think I'm annoying and bothersome, but my girlfriend says I'm just fine. I don't think so, I think I'm stressing everyone else out
  - bot: '"Where you put your attention is where you will go". I forget who said this first, but it''s very powerful. If all you think about and talk about is how annoying you think you might be, that will get annoying.'
- story: How can I get my fiancé to notice me again?
  steps:
  - user: My fiancé and I have almost the best relationship every girl wants, but lately it's changed. I get less attention and little to no intercourse. He works a lot and goes to the gym a lot (he's a football player for an indoor league), but he has no time for me.
  - bot: Hello, It doesn't feel good when it seems that your partner no longer cares or cares less for you, especially if your feelings have not changed. It can be scary, frustrating, and lonely. Have you tried talking to him about your concerns? I would suggest to start there.
- story: How can I forgive myself?
  steps:
  - user: Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for. When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.
  - bot: What a beautiful discussion of guilt and shame Lynda offers! Those two demons start out as pesky and little when we are young, then grow with us to become quite formidable. I'd like to throw in a technique I learned from Randy Rausch (author of  The Last Lecture)  called The 3-Step Apology.
- story: How do I learn to let go of past problems and live one day at a time?
  steps:
  - user: I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.
  - bot: Staying present is an attitude most of us aspire to, and most of us have to work at it—certainly at first. I’m here to tell you that living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn. Unfortunately, the only way to do it is to do it. What a paradox!
- story: I don't know if I should end my relationship or try and stick through it.
  steps:
  - user: I have been dating a guy for two years. I think I love him, but I don't know any more. I am in my late teens, and I have been living with him for most of our relationship. I have been talking to a guy friend, and I feel more loved by him than my boyfriend.
  - bot: Hi Michigan, Relationships are so sparkly for a few years, and then things start to feel different. Most of the time, this is simply because we've pulled back from all the attachment-forming behaviours we did at the beginning.
- story: How can I forgive myself?
  steps:
  - user: Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for. When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.
  - bot: A lot of times it is not about forgiveness but learning from experiences. As an example, as a child we continously fall in an effort to learn how to walk. Then when we begin walking we know we have to put one foot in front of the other in order to move forward.
- story: How do I cope with bad thoughts?
  steps:
  - user: People have been calling me names, and I have had enough of it. I cannot stand it anymore I'm done. I have told someone this, and that is why I am writing this. The thoughts are awful.
  - bot: It's sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts and are feeling very criticized by others as well. I think it is great that you are reaching out and I can tell that you want this to change.
- story: I feel like there is a wedge between my daughter and I.
  steps:
  - user: We live with my ex-partner’s sister and her husband. We have been there for five years now. They are Hispanic and talk to my daughter in their language. Sometimes they overstep their balance between aunt and uncle and reach into my role as a parent. They neglect to see this.
  - bot: Hi New York, I'm happy to hear that your daughter doesn't know about her dad's addictions. A lthough you don't say how old she is, and I imagine that at some point in her life she will be ready to know the truth, I trust your instinct that now is not the time.
- story: I feel guilty because I didn't say no to a guy's advances.
  steps:
  - user: I was in a situation with a guy. He’s my brother’s friend and kind of like a brother to me. He invited me over to hang out, and then came on to me. I was instantly terrified to say no, and I gave in. I don't know what's wrong with me. I can't figure out why I'm afraid to say no.
  - bot: Hi Tennessee, There is nothing wrong with you. There are many good reasons why you didn't say no. You didn't say no because you were caught off guard and unprepared; there is no place in life that teaches girls or boys how to manage it when someone crashes a sexual boundary.
- story: Thoughts of afterlife causes anxiety
  steps:
  - user: Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed.
  - bot: Hi California, What you're experiencing is indeed anxiety; it's very common. Through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety. I'll get you started and it's a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you well.
- story: How do I handle my binge eating?
  steps:
  - user: I have a problem with binge eating, especially during times of stress. I binge eat and feel so overwhelmed with shame and disappointment that I end up going to the gym and trying to exercise the calories off. I am in my late 20s, and I have been dealing with this since I was a teenager.
  - bot: In dealing with an eating disorder you are far from alone. It is more common than you might think and tied to so many variables that it is easy for an individual to become overwhelmed in trying to navigate the influences of such variables.
- story: Our grandson wants to talk to his estranged mom.
  steps:
  - user: We are the legal guardianship of our grandson. He has been acting out, and he wants to talk to his mom that has not talked to him since before last year. How are we to handle this?
  - bot: Hi Boone, This depends a lot on his age and the situation. The younger the child is, in general, the more I would see this as your decision, not his.
- story: How do I stay when the spark is gone?
  steps:
  - user: We had our first kid 15 years ago, and sex has been nonexistent ever since. It only happens every three or four months. We have been to counseling, and I have been told over and over again she will come around. She hasn't, and I'm intimately lonely!
  - bot: Hi Pocahontas, This is a painful situation. When you're in a relationship, you assume that you will continue to receive warmth and affection. When it dries up, it's a very lonely place. It's possible that there is an unaddressed issue in the relationship.
- story: How do I deal with sexual tension?
  steps:
  - user: I have been experiencing a lot of sexual tension with a lot of the guys that I talk to nowadays. I keep imagining having sex with them. I have never had sex before, nor have I had a boyfriend. I feel lonely and empty. I feel like my body is not okay, and I am missing something.
  - bot: Hi Montreal, I'm glad you wrote. What you're experiencing is normal. We're sexual beings.
- story: Why does it feel as if self-harm is an addiction?
  steps:
  - user: I self-harm, and I stop for awhile. Then when I see something sad or depressing, I automatically want to self-harm.
  - bot: In a way, self-harm can present somewhat like an addiction. According to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this. When a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm, the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better.
- story: I feel insecure, on edge, and drink too much.
  steps:
  - user: I feel insecure in my life. I don't think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does. I have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues. I have had a drinking problem for a few years.
  - bot: Given the description you have posted here, it may be time to find someone to work with. First and foremost, look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking.
- story: How can I be more open and honest with my dad?
  steps:
  - user: I avoid talking to him because he always makes me more upset. I can't be honest with him about anything because he is always rude to me.
  - bot: Hi Troy, I totally get this. It's a dilemma; you want your dad to know how he's hurting you but you don't feel safe enough to say anything to him. Your reaction is understandable; it's his responsibility as a parent to work harder than you to create that safe place for you to be open.
- story: How can I unblock my memories?
  steps:
  - user: As a child, my parents injured my brother, so they went to prison. I was there when he had gotten hurt, but I can't seem to remember. I also can't remember being with them quite well. It's a blur.
  - bot: It's important to know that there are counselors who are trained in working with survivors of trauma and you can get help. The "blur" in your memories is your brain's attempt to protect you from the experiences in your past.
- story: Is this depression?
  steps:
  - user: I feel like I am internally screaming all the time. Externally, I am calm, but I have this intense, unidentifiable emotion constantly. I don't feel sad. I don't cry a lot. I feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming. It kind of feels like I'm a caged animal.
  - bot: As far as the formal diagnosis of depression goes, it would be hard to determine without more information. It sounds like you are noticing that there is a significant difference between how you are feeling on the inside and how you express yourself outwardly.
- story: How can I unblock my memories?
  steps:
  - user: As a child, my parents injured my brother, so they went to prison. I was there when he had gotten hurt, but I can't seem to remember. I also can't remember being with them quite well. It's a blur.
  - bot: Sorry to hear of having witnessed violence within your family when you were very young. Your blocked memories are a self-protection from the enormous emotional pain and feeling de-stabilized by realizing that the people whom you expected to trust, are harmful.
- story: How can I get over social anxiety?
  steps:
  - user: I have not had a friend since I was 19. I don't go anywhere, and I have no job, all because I'm afraid of people.
  - bot: Individual and/or group therapy can be a powerful antidote for social anxiety.
- story: I feel insecure, on edge, and drink too much.
  steps:
  - user: I feel insecure in my life. I don't think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does. I have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues. I have had a drinking problem for a few years.
  - bot: Sorry hearing about the big amount of stress which you are feeling at this time. Since a lot of your stress is directed to uncertainty of whether your wife is happy being with you, would you consider continuing the conversation with her about your understanding of her answer to you?
- story: Why am I so mad?
  steps:
  - user: My issue isn't resisting angry urges; it's the anger itself. My rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor. It causes violent thoughts, but I never act. I stay lucid enough to know the rage is violent, not me. I don't want to drown myself in anger and resentment.
  - bot: Knowing how you feel and also being able to stabilize yourself to act upon the tremendous anger you feel, are fine qualities. Anger, whatever the magnitude, generally reflects emotional pain that has not yet been placed into words.
- story: How do I get back to my fun, happy self again?
  steps:
  - user: I always see the worst end of things. My boyfriend and I aren't talking, and I swear he's leaving me. I keep failing my road test, and I see my future crumble. I have no desire for friends. I pushed my best friend away after Christmas, and I have no desire to fix it or make new friends.
  - bot: I really love that you're taking responsibility for your pessimism here. There's a modern parable about two young brothers. One child is in a room full of every toy you could imagine, and he's miserable; the other is in a room full of horse manure, and he's flinging it around with joy.
- story: Is it bad that I'm giving my ex-boyfriend another chance?
  steps:
  - user: I was in a relationship with him for three years. My mom doesn't like it because she thinks I'm making a mistake. He got married a few months after we broke up, and now he is divorced. I forgave him for what he did in the past, and he says he’s sorry and he really loves me.
  - bot: Hey, it might be mistake in the end but this is a risk you want to take and you get to make your own mistakes. Your mom wants to protect you; I get that. Maybe she is worried you'll be hurt again. Were you hurt in some way by him? Can you understand where she's coming from?
- story: How can I love myself?
  steps:
  - user: I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died.
  - bot: I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes.
- story: Why do I keep letting myself get cheated on?
  steps:
  - user: I've been with the mother of my child for years.
  - bot: I would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better. I would suggest that you get to know yourself. What do you NEED in a relationship? What is holding you to this relationship other than your child?
- story: How can I create a better relationship with my adoptive mother?
  steps:
  - user: We just cannot seem to get along. I cannot have a conversation with her without it turning into World War 3. She treats me like I have no right to an opinion and never really lets me speak.
  - bot: Going to see a experience counselor would be my advice. You will have a neutral person that can listen to both sides and help you all find a common ground of understanding. If she doesn't agree to counseling, really the only person you can change is you.
- story: Why am I all of a sudden having issues communicating with the guy I’m dating?
  steps:
  - user: I started seeing this guy that I met at a mutual friend’s place. He recently broke up with his ex-girlfriend and started seeing me. Everything was great in the beginning, then I started having low self-esteem thoughts and thinking he was hanging with his ex-girlfriend again. It’s all I think about.
  - bot: Sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts. As you stated, everything was great then you started having low self-esteem thoughts and thinking. What is contributing to these negative thoughts? His actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question..
- story: How do I cope with posttraumatic stress disorder and its triggers?
  steps:
  - user: I am a survivor of multiple sexual abuse/rape experiences. Triggers are having an effect on my daily life and my sexual relationship with my partner. I'm trying to learn to cope with them.
  - bot: Have you tried counseling? Having PTSD from multiple abusive sexual experiences is very overwhelming for one to handle alone. You may need the guidance, experience and support of a professional to identify all the triggers that effect you and obtain the best coping skills that would work for you.
- story: How do I get to know myself?
  steps:
  - user: I am a single mother. As a child, I was molested by my mother's boyfriend. I never knew my father. I started having children at 18 right after high school. After having children, I completely lost myself and gave all of my focus on my children.
  - bot: What your are experience is normal for most women. We usually forget about self and totally focus on our children putting our personal wants and needs aside.
- story: If I'm not with my boyfriend, I have emotional breakdowns.
  steps:
  - user: I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. He loves me a lot, and I love him. It hurts to be apart from him for so long. It hurts all over, and then I feel like it won't last.
  - bot: I would suggest that you look up the word codependency and it's characteristics. See if you relate to those characteristics. I have a feeling you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly. For some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss.
- story: Is this depression?
  steps:
  - user: I feel like I am internally screaming all the time. Externally, I am calm, but I have this intense, unidentifiable emotion constantly. I don't feel sad. I don't cry a lot. I feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming. It kind of feels like I'm a caged animal.
  - bot: It is hard to make a definite diagnosis however I would say that it could be and or a combination of depression, stress, PTSD, etc. More background information would have to be needed. One thing I would say is that you really need to seek guidance from a professional to work through these symptoms.
- story: Why do my boyfriend and I have such trouble communicating?
  steps:
  - user: We’ve been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesn’t love me. It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved?
  - bot: Under duress the very youngest parts of you and your boyfriend emerge. So, while you still look like grown ups, your actions and words are motivated by very early preverbal parts of both of you.
- story: How can I stop being so angry?
  steps:
  - user: I have not been able to really sleep. I stay up all times of the night not even knowing why. Every day, I feel like I have anger inside of me. I have a little family, but I can't open up to them like I want to. I have a son, and I feel that I take my anger out on him by screaming at him.
  - bot: Best question is....what are you so angry about? You can't stop being so angry until you figure out what is the root of your anger. If you feel like you have anger inside, while I am sure you do. Taking it out on your son is only passing on the hurt and anger. This will be inside him too.
- story: I've been having breakdowns for no reason at all.
  steps:
  - user: I start to think of an issue that doesn't even matter or something bad that happened years ago. Then, I cry, pull at my hair, plug my ears, hit myself, and throw things. In loud public places, I get on edge and start being sarcastic and moody.
  - bot: There is a reason you are having breakdowns. I can't agree that they happen for "no reason at all". Finding out the reason is going to be your biggest challenge because that may require you to dig deep into your past, uncover hurtful experiences, or recognize something that would be extremely pain.
- story: My boyfriend isn't sexually performing like he did before I found out he was cheating.
  steps:
  - user: Now that the other girl is out of the picture, our sex life isn't the same. Is it because he is still thinking about the other girl?
  - bot: Or...better yet... Is it you still thinking about the other girl? I am sure his cheating hurt you emotionally and may have affected your sexual performance as well. Make sure the other girl is out the picture on your end as well.
- story: I think my trust issues are going to end my relationship early.
  steps:
  - user: As I was growing up, my mother and father always fought. With that, I grew trust issues. I think it's going to affect my relationship now and end it sooner then I want to. I try not to let it affect me, but I can’t.
  - bot: If you thing your trust issues are going to end or affect your relationship it will because you are being baggage from your parents into this relationship. Don't allow their problems to become your problem.
- story: How can I deal with the anger problems I've gained from my soon-to-be husband?
  steps:
  - user: I been having anger problems a lot lately. It only takes one word wrongly said to set me off. I use to not be like this until I got with my soon-to-be husband. I think his mood and rage/anger problems have rubbed off on me a lot.
  - bot: With me knowing that a healthy relationship usually includes respect, trust, appreciation, companionship, spiritual solidarity, domestic support, feeling of being cherished, and sensuous affection, I am wondering if you are lacking in several if not all of these needs in your present relationship.
- story: Is it healthy to embarrass a child as punishment?
  steps:
  - user: My grandson's step-mother sends him to school with a pink Barbie backpack as a form of punishment.

- story: How do I tell my parents that I'm depressed and need help?
  steps:
  - user: I'm depressed. I have been for years. I hide it from everyone because I'm scared of the reactions I'll get.
  - bot: Don't think that you can't afford the help you need on your own. There are several counselors that see people on a sliding scale that can be as low as $5 (based on your income). Find a center that is non-profit, they have great counselors as well.

  steps:
  - user: I have several issues like I don't like people. They make me sick. I have issues with talking to people. I feel like they are talking about me and making fun of me. I have felt this way for years.
  - bot: Sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain. I would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically. Then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist.
- story: I'm not sure if I want to trust my husband again.
  steps:
  - user: My husband used a lot of negative words to hurt me, and I moved out. He is seeing a counselor and wants another chance to make things right. I'm not sure if I trust that he will not go back to his old ways.
  - bot: I am glad he is seeing a counselor. That is something that most men struggle with doing at times. Time will tell if his actions are of good intentions. However remember that a person can only do to you what you allow them to do in relationships. What part did you play?
- story: How do I handle my binge eating?
  steps:
  - user: I have a problem with binge eating, especially during times of stress. I binge eat and feel so overwhelmed with shame and disappointment that I end up going to the gym and trying to exercise the calories off. I am in my late 20s, and I have been dealing with this since I was a teenager.

- story: I'm scared to tell my family that I'm bisexual.
  steps:
  - user: My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.

- story: How can I get over my posttraumatic stress disorder without my parents knowing about it?
  steps:
  - user: I've had posttraumatic stress disorder for years without my parents ever finding out. I want to overcome it, but it’s so vivid, it’s like it’s happening again. I'm scared and paranoid. I have depression, which I have been struggling with since a young age.

  - bot: Perhaps you are not ready to come out to your parents. Often times our readiness is not dependent on what others' will say or how they react. But more so dependent on how emotionally prepared we are to deal with others' reactions.
- story: How can I avoid becoming wrapped up in family issues and control my anxiety about them?
  steps:
  - user: I started dating my fiancé two years ago. My first cousin is married to my fiancé’s sister. There has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife. My uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin, and it upsets my mom.

- story: How do I handle my binge eating?
  steps:
  - user: I have a problem with binge eating, especially during times of stress. I binge eat and feel so overwhelmed with shame and disappointment that I end up going to the gym and trying to exercise the calories off. I am in my late 20s, and I have been dealing with this since I was a teenager.
  - bot: The fact that you are aware of the issue and what causes it is a step in the right direction. You can absolutely break the cycle but it takes a lot of effort. Much like growing a physical muscle, developing coping mechanisms must be practiced (exercised) in order to gain strength.

  steps:
  - user: I feel so irritated and frustrated because of it. I get so angry to the point that I feel like I'm going to explode. I feel pathetic, stupid, and worthless. I just can't take this anymore.

  steps:
  - user: I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex.
  - bot: I'm not a super religious person... But I can't imagine that if you love him that much and you want him that much, that he wouldn't be the one for you because of something small like that. Sex is an act of love and commitment.
- story: Thoughts of afterlife causes anxiety
  steps:
  - user: Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed.
  - bot: You need to find an outlet. Someone to talk to. Your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal. But anyone could help. Just look to someone for help. If you can't find anyone who you think will listen, talk to your mom. It can help greatly just to get the words out.

  steps:
  - user: I've had posttraumatic stress disorder for years without my parents ever finding out. I want to overcome it, but it’s so vivid, it’s like it’s happening again. I'm scared and paranoid. I have depression, which I have been struggling with since a young age.

- story: Why do my boyfriend and I have such trouble communicating?
  steps:
  - user: We’ve been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesn’t love me. It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved?
  - bot: Try having a conversation with your boyfriend about your views and wishes for the relationship, when the two of you are having a calm time. A few questions I'd like to ask him is why he says he doesn't love you when the topic at hand is about a specific practical matter.
- story: I am 18 years old with a baby on the way
  steps:
  - user: Me and the father of my child have been dating for a year. We had a big argument and at first he wanted to work it out. But with time he started asking others and they told him to leave me. Now he wants me to wait on him to mature. He wants to talk to other people. Then come back in four years.
  - bot: Well, as far as your boyfriend, sounds like he has received advice from others that is not wise advice. Leaving is not the answer after a "big argument" as you mentioned. However this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level.
- story: How can I forgive myself?
  steps:
  - user: Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for. When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.

  steps:
  - user: I get so much anxiety, and I don’t know why. I feel like I can’t do anything by myself because I’m scared of the outcomes.
  - bot: This is a very common question in my practice. Panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue (ex. Depression, low self-esteem, fears).
- story: Why do my boyfriend and I have such trouble communicating?
  steps:
  - user: We’ve been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesn’t love me. It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved?
  - bot: Communication involves a listener and a speaker. Both have to be willing to do their part to make communication work. This is something that takes both and not just one. Without both, communication is impossible. Staying together and the kids observing unhealthy communication is already broken.
- story: My boyfriend says he needs time to think about us
  steps:
  - user: I found out my boyfriend takes anti-depression medicine. Lately he's been saying he has a lot on his mind, and he needs time to think about us. We've only been dating 3 weeks but I like him a lot.
  - bot: Give him the time and space he needs. Obviously something is going on with him that he needs time to process, think about, and work through. Respect that most men are not talkers but more thinkers. If and when he is ready to talk, he will.

  steps:
  - user: Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get light-headed, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.
  - bot: As you do it more, it should get better or at less with less anxiety. Anxiety is normal for most when speaking in public. I hear this from even the best of facilitators who have been doing it for years. I even experienced that when I first became a counselor and had to lead classes.
- story: What can I do if my coworkers accuse me of mood swings?
  steps:
  - user: My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?

- story: I've been having the same dream since I was a child.
  steps:
  - user: I am a teenage girl. I've been seeing the same dream once in a while since I was very young. The problem is that I don't remember anything about this dream. I still know that it's the same one, and then I wake up in a panic, and I cry really loud without knowing the reason.
  - bot: There is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams, that I know about, however, many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean.

  steps:
  - user: My mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though I'm in my 20s. She argues with me over stupid stuff.

  - bot: You can't fix this by yourself, but I applaud you for trying. One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while., but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort.
- story: How can I avoid becoming wrapped up in family issues and control my anxiety about them?
  steps:
  - user: I started dating my fiancé two years ago. My first cousin is married to my fiancé’s sister. There has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife. My uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin, and it upsets my mom.
  - bot: When you're upset about something, the first question you can ask yourself is "Whose problem is this?" It is amazing how many problems will disappear right at that point, because you realize the problem isn't even yours. You can't fix everything in your family.
- story: A friend of my child's father is sending him inappropriate content
  steps:
  - user: I believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content. The father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs. His co-worker sent him an inappropriate video. He got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that.

- story: I cheated on my partner, and I don't know how to feel.
  steps:
  - user: I am married, but I had sex with my friend. I feel guilty, but I feel not guilty too. Do I need to feel guilty? It's my body, and I have full rights to do what I like.
  - bot: Yes, of course, it's your body and you can do what you feel like doing. Do you feel a commitment to your partner? Your guilt probably is pointing out the feeling of having done with your body what your spirit tells you is a violation of the commitment you feel toward your partner.
- story: How do I tell my boyfriend I wanna be with him but not in a relationship?
  steps:
  - user: I've been with him for a couple months. We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me. We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that. I still wanna be with him, but not now.
  - bot: Why don't you just tell him everything that you just wrote here? You're clear in your mind as to what you would like. Unless you have a whole either side to the way you feel, everything you wrote here explains your position very well. Good luck in having your conversation!

  - bot: The greatest sex experience will be with someone who you feel connected to outside the bed. This is something that you should feel comfortable in talking with your partner about. The relationship needs to be strong before moving to the bed anyways.
- story: What should I do if I found out one of my parents are cheating?
  steps:
  - user: I saw my mother cheating on my dad before. I said something to her, and she said it was in the past. Yesterday, I saw her texting dirty things to the same guy. Should I talk to her again? I don't want my parents to go their separate ways, I just want her to stop. it's not fair.
  - bot: You as the child in the middle of your parents' problems is the worse position to be in. I can only imagine your hurt, pain and confusion on what to do.
- story: How do I tell my boyfriend I wanna be with him but not in a relationship?
  steps:
  - user: I've been with him for a couple months. We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me. We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that. I still wanna be with him, but not now.
  - bot: I have learned that the best approach is to say that you need the time to get yourself together, mature, learn, outside of a intimate relationship but just in a friend to friend relationship...don't blame him or point fingers at him.... most likely if you did that it would not go well.

  steps:
  - user: I get angry and act out. It scares my wife and child.

  steps:

- story: Can anxiety make me think I heard something about me?
  steps:
  - user: When I'm around people, I sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something. I will be focusing on something else and then randomly think I hear something about me. I never know if it was actually said.
  - bot: It sounds like you are having difficulty knowing if people are saying things to you, or if you only thought someone was talking to you, and this is anxiety producing. It's understandable that it could be confusing and/or a bit scary to be unsure if people are speaking to you or not.

- story: I am afraid of sex.
  steps:
  - user: I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.
  - bot: As hard as it may be to do this, since all the media and marketing of how an ideal person looks and performs sexually, surrounds us, keep in mind that the images presented in order to sell movies and almost any product, is meant to trigger fantasies. No one is a fantasy, we are all real and unique.

  steps:
  - user: I get so much anxiety, and I don’t know why. I feel like I can’t do anything by myself because I’m scared of the outcomes.

  steps:
  - user: I am married, but I had sex with my friend. I feel guilty, but I feel not guilty too. Do I need to feel guilty? It's my body, and I have full rights to do what I like.
  - bot: I don't think there's anything that you're supposed to feel. Some people feel tremendously guilty when they cheat, and others not at all. It could be that your partner doesn't know about the cheating and you haven't had to face his/her emotions and reactions.

We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that. I still wanna be with him, but not now.

- story: How can I see if a therapist if my mom can't afford it?
  steps:

  - bot: It can be difficult to get counseling if you don't feel supported by family members. There might be a few options. If you are in school, I'd recommend talking to a school counselor or school nurse. They often will be able to help you access free or affordable counseling resources in your community.
- story: Is there a lawsuit for counselors and therapists who failed to report a relapse?

  steps:
  - user: My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she didn't have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.
  - bot: Hello! Thank you for your question. I have a worked with many people who have become addicted to benzodiazepines, like Clonazepam.

- story: How can I forgive myself?
  steps:
  - user: Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for. When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.

  - bot: ' Hello, and thank you for your question. Being bisexual can be particularly difficult because it is often misunderstood, even by people who are “supposed” to be part of your own community, such as lesbians and gays. It happens so often that there is actually a term for it –  bi-erasure.'

  steps:
  - user: Nothing we've tried has worked so far.

- story: Why am I so protective of my friends and family?
  steps:
  - user: Any time my family and friends are in an altercation, I’m the one who steps in. I’m the one they call to fight for them. I do this even though I have a tough time trusting the people I’m fighting for. I’m only in my early 20s.
  - bot: Breaking the patterns of relating to family members, is difficult work. In the situation you describe, both you and the family members who ask for your intervention, will be affected by any change you decide to make in the way all of you handle family disagreements.

  - bot: When we feel overwhelmed by life situations, it is important to understand where the feeling is coming from. Once we understand the source, it is important to normalize the situations that got us there and find balance in our lives.
- story: What can I do about my dad being on drugs?
  steps:
  - user: My dad is doing some really bad drugs, and I'm not allowed to see him anymore because of what he can do to me or my siblings on this drug. It has affected me tremendously in my life. It’s even caused me anger and stress.
  - bot: It seems like you are going trough stages of grief, since the inability to see your father causes you similar feelings as if you had lost him. Perhaps you could send him letters expressing your feelings and hopes.

I can't get a job. I have no friends. I feel lonely and isolated.
  - bot: One thing that may help is to focus on small things that you do have control over.
- story: How do I know if my daughter has bipolar disorder?
  steps:
  - user: My daughter basically freaked out out of nowhere over me saying “calm down” when she dropped her phone. Within seconds, the situation escalated to her kicking me out on the curb, saying horrifically unspeakable things, and her calling the cops on me. She seems unable to stop herself at times.
  - bot: Bipolar disorder has a lot of different components. If this is a one-time event, it could be that your daughter had an intense moment of anger and the phrase of asking her to "calm down" may have made her feel as though you weren't understanding what she was saying.
- story: Is it weird or dangerous to give myself advice through an imaginary friend?
  steps:
  - user: I'm a teenager, and I created a sort of imaginary friend to help me cope with stressful situations or if I'm worried or upset. She "gives me advice" and comforts me and tells me it'll be okay. I've given her a name (Solace) and created a personality for her that's like a comforting motherly figure.
  - bot: Since you are saying that you know that the thoughts are yours and your thinking of them in a different person's voice to make them easier for you to follow through on, it doesn't sound like it could develop into another personality.
- story: How do I fix or leave a bad relationship?
  steps:
  - user: My ex-boyfriend and I have been back and forth for over a year now. He's in his late 20s, divorced for like five years now with two kids. He has a lot of narcissistic behaviors. He lies and cheats, but I love him. I've tried to date other people, but I always go back to him.

- story: How do I pick which parents house I want to live at?
  steps:
  - user: My mom and dad got divorced four years ago. I had to finish out the school year with my dad, and now they are deciding which place is best for me. I can't choose. How can I choose if I love both places?
  - bot: I don't know how old you are, but depending on that, you may be able to talk with them about spending some time in both places. Even parents who live in different states can do that sometimes.
- story: How can I be happier and healthier?
  steps:
  - user: I've tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables, but I always seem to eat the junk in the house.
  - bot: I know some people do better when they don't have as much junk food in the house. This is not as tempting then. Having said that, maybe you can reward yourself with different things, such as having dessert on certain days.
- story: How can I be less angry?
  steps:
  - user: I get really mad easily at my parents and family.
  - bot: Anger is not necessarily a bad thing. If you are angry and you can talk about your feelings, that would be very helpful. Anger usually comes along with something else, like feeling sad, worried, overwhelmed, confused, and many others.
- story: Does my daughter have a mental disability?
  steps:
  - user: My daughter is in later elementary school. She can't color in the lines. Her words jumble together when she writes unless there are big spaces or she skips lines.

- story: How do I pick between two guys?
  steps:
  - user: I'm dating a guy I really love. We have our problems, but I could see myself with him long term. But there's this other guy who I've had feelings for for awhile now. He gives me butterflies when we talk, and my heart beats fast when I see he's texted me, which i never felt with my current boyfriend.
  - bot: There are different types of attraction. You said that you've never felt this sort of feeling of your heart beating faster with your current boyfriend.
- story: Is it possible that I have depression?
  steps:
  - user: I'm starting to think that I might have depression. The thing is though, I'm not exactly sad. I can joke with my friends and stuff, but I've stopped caring about my work, and I've been starting to think that life is pointless. I really have no clue if I need help, or if I'm just tired or something.
  - bot: It is possible that you have depression, but you could also be experiencing some other changes that mean that you have feelings of being sad without actually being depressed. Your statement makes it sound like you've stopped caring about your work, but you're still going to work and doing your work.
- story: Why can't I laugh anymore?
  steps:
  - user: I used to be the funny guy of the group—the class clown, if you will. I used to laugh uncontrollably all the time and be able to be social without it feeling awkward. Now I can't laugh at all, and I'm dead inside.
  - bot: If you look back to when you feel as though you were the "funny guy," I wonder what is different now? It may be that responsibilities have changed or any number of other things.
- story: Why am I so sad?
  steps:
  - user: I have friends, family, I live in a good home, I go to a nice high school, and I get pretty good grades, but I don’t know why I'm so unhappy. These friends are my best friends and they’re all amazing people, and yet I'm sad all the time and feel alone.
  - bot: I wonder if you have moments where you feel happy? You say you have amazing friends. I wonder if you get along with them and feel as though you can be yourself around them.
- story: How do I handle my fiancée always telling me how bad of a job I'm doing in making them happy?
  steps:
  - user: My fiancée is always letting me know how I am a horrible/evil person, or I just don’t care enough when it’s about her feeling or when she is having an off day.
  - bot: One thing you could try is to have a conversation when neither of you is upset so that you learn what makes each of you feel cared for and valued. It could be that you are showing caring in a way that doesn't quite match what she is really looking for in that moment.
- story: How can you get back to my old self?
  steps:
  - user: I no longer carry expressions on my face, and my emotions are decreasing the more I have fights with my fiancée.

- story: How can I resist the urge to cut?
  steps:
  - user: I stopped for a while, but I’ve started doing it again. It’s like an addiction. The more I try to stop, the more I want to do it. I’ve tried doing some of the stuff they say to do like draw, but it doesn’t work.
  - bot: I've heard people say that they cut themselves as a way to feel relief from different emotions. You're also right that when you try to focus on just not cutting, it becomes more difficult because it's what you are focused on.
- story: How can I resist the urge to cut?
  steps:
  - user: When I'm sad and alone, I want to cut myself.
  - bot: Try doing something physical. If you haven't exercised before, it is a good idea to get your doctor's approval first, but this can be helpful. The more you can find out about when you want to cut, the easier it will be to figure out what else you can do.
- story: Is it normal to hate my mom?
  steps:
  - user: She has chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and I’m her caregiver. All she does is complain, hit me, call me names, and say things happened that didn’t. When I tell her, she explodes.
  - bot: It sounds like you are hating some of the things that your mom does rather than hating her. Something you may be able to do is call the area agency on aging for the county where you live and ask for information about having other people help to care for your mom.
- story: Why do I always think my girl is cheating on me?
  steps:
  - user: She works with a man and always looks at guys that check her out.
  - bot: I wonder if you are having some of these thoughts related to something that has neither happened directly to you in your past or to someone that you care about. This can often change the way that we look at different situations.
- story: Why do I get a weird feeling every few months or so?
  steps:
  - user: I get an uncontrollable swallowing that is repetitive and then somewhat out of body feeling that lasts no more than a minute or two. It usually happens in bed at night, but I occasionally experience this during the day. I have a benign brain tumor, but the doctor said it is not associated with this.
  - bot: I'm not entirely sure whether this relates to something in the mental health realm or if there is something else happening. I know you said that your doctor said it is not related to your physical condition, but have you tried speaking with your primary care physician?
- story: Can hypnosis allow me to recall trauma from 35 years ago?

  - bot: The answer here really depends upon your age and something called the "age of consent" in the state where you live. In Pennsylvania, anyone over the age of 14 can provide consent for their own treatment. As for billing purposes, try talking to some local agencies.
- story: How do I overcome my depression?
  steps:
  - user: I feel depressed even though I act like a happy with my family. I act like I’m happy so my son doesn’t see me sad. I act like my life is a happy life, but I feel sad and depressed. I sometimes think of killing myself and that my family deserve someone better than me.
  - bot: It sounds like you have several different things happening at the same time. I would encourage you to call and speak to a local therapist. If you are having thoughts of killing yourself in this moment, please call 800-273-8255 and talk to someone.
- story: Why am I so protective of my friends and family?
  steps:
  - user: Any time my family and friends are in an altercation, I’m the one who steps in. I’m the one they call to fight for them. I do this even though I have a tough time trusting the people I’m fighting for. I’m only in my early 20s.
  - bot: You could be protective because of things that happened in your past or in the past of the people that you are protecting. A lot of us have natural instincts that we do not want other people to be in pain. For other people, conflict is just hard to watch and/or listen to.
- story: How do I move past my depression from being separated from the military?
  steps:
  - user: Two years ago, I was separated from the military into my contract for medical issues. It has emotionally destroyed me. I now basically hate myself. It's embarrassing to be separated from the one place who takes anyone. My family has been in the armed forces, and it has always been my dream.
  - bot: It sounds like being separated from the armed forces is a major loss for you. It takes some time to work through the emotions related to this and it often takes longer if you are trying to work through it without a lot of support.
- story: How do I kick my stepdaughter out of our house because she isn't honoring boundaries set for her?
  steps:
  - user: She's in her early 20s, and she has a toddler.
  - bot: It may be helpful to first have a discussion about what you are expecting and put a timeframe on it that if she is not doing certain things by a certain date, she will have to leave. If you don't know where she can go, there is probably a list of shelters for the county that you live in.
- story: What should I do about not being sexually attracted to my girlfriend of five years?
  steps:
  - user: Nothing we've tried has worked so far.
  - bot: Sexual attraction is often discussed on a continuum. If you are saying that you are not attracted to your girlfriend, you could try changing what you do during sexual intimacy.
- story: How can I just be happy and not mad all the time?
  steps:
  - user: Everything just makes me upset.

- story: How can I make girls love me and not just the attention I give them?
  steps:
  - user: 'Ever since I was little, I loved the idea of loving someone and spending my whole life with them. I treated everyone nice. For girls I liked, I would spend every second with them. It always ends the same way: “I like you as a friend,” or “I love your attention but not you.”'
  - bot: Attention is often something that is both wanted and sometimes not wanted all the time. Maybe when you're in a relationship with someone you can discuss the amount of attention that you are both comfortable with and/or what you are both looking for as far as amount of connection.
- story: How do I deal with my husband being mean to me?
  steps:
  - user: My father is in the hospital and was diagnosed with leukemia. I have been dealing with that all day. My husband keeps getting mad at me for things that I said.
  - bot: I don't know how long you have been married, but this might be a time to explain to your husband what you wish he could do for you in this moment. It could be that he is showing that he is getting mad at you because he is worried about you and it is just coming out wrong.
- story: Is my relationship with my stepdad normal?
  steps:
  - user: My stepdad and I always mess around. I've noticed that whenever he playfully hits me, it's always my butt that he hits. He always comments on my outfits and always scans me head to toe when I walk into a room. I'm a teenager female, and I want to know if this is normal.
  - bot: It's hard to tell from the way you described it. Do you think he would be open to an honest discussion? It could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter.
- story: Why does my granddaughter instantly switch moods?
  steps:
  - user: She was diagnosed a type one diabetic two years ago and had a very tough time dealing with it. She has an attachment issue also; her mother just moved to a much nicer home, and she gets angry and demands to go back to her prior home. We do not understand what is going on, and it is driving us crazy.
  - bot: There are many possible answers here. It could be that she misses friends, that she felt safe in the other house (emotionally safe and comfortable), or dozens of other things. Will she talk about it when she's not mad? You mentioned that she has an attachment issue.
- story: Why do I think about how easy it would be to hurt cute animals?
  steps:
  - user: Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. There've even been split-seconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.
  - bot: A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?
- story: How do I balance school and life?
  steps:
  - user: I don't have time to live or take care of myself at times. It's causing depression, stress, and anxiety. I don't know what to do.
  - bot: I'm not sure whether you are referring to having a lot of activities after school or that homework is overwhelming. Can you set aside a couple hours a week for yourself as a place to start?
- story: How do I deal with my trauma?
  steps:
  - user: I was a victim of an incident. I've been made fun of and have been beating myself up for it because I don't feel anyone honestly believes me. There are so many other factors I deal with on a daily basis. I ignore my problems when I'm with my friends, but it’s scary when I’m alone.
  - bot: I'm glad you have some time when you're not thinking about your trauma when you're with your friends. As far as feeling scared when you are alone, I'm not sure if you are referring to having flashbacks or thoughts on what happened to you or reminders in the environment around you or something else.
- story: How can I make my mom love me the same as my siblings?
  steps:
  - user: I have three siblings. My mom loves them and not me. She’s always yelling at me, but when it comes to my siblings, she talks to them. I’m always crying in my room.
  - bot: Have you ever tried talking with her about this when she's not angry? While I hear you saying that it feels like she doesn't love you, there could be a lot of other pieces to this. Have you ever told her about how much she means to you (when she's not angry)?
- story: How can I be happy as a stay-at-home mom?
  steps:
  - user: 'Over the years, I have slowly lost everything: my jobs, my cars, my freedom, and my money. I am a stay-at-home mom who doesn''t make any money, doesn''t have a car, never goes out, and cleans all day long everyday.'

- story: How do I talk to my girlfriend about my anxiety from her exes?
  steps:
  - user: My girlfriend remains friends with ex boyfriends/lovers on Facebook who actively like and comment on posts. It causes me to get jealous because I'm afraid they might reconnect somehow. I've attempted to talk to her about it, but she avoids it and doesn't seem to worry about how I feel about it.
  - bot: Talking about it would probably be helpful if you're both in a place where you can decide when is best to talk about something that is important. It may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time.
- story: How do I stop feeling so awful?
  steps:
  - user: I'm not the same anymore, I don't know how to get back to who I am. I'm sad and confused and angry and tired. I don't sleep well.
  - bot: Being tired can really affect almost everyone's ability to work through things that make them sad, confused, or angry, among other emotions. If you're having difficulty sleeping, try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day.
- story: What can I do about my boyfriend insulting my body?
  steps:
  - user: I'm in my early 20s, and I've been seeing my boyfriend for a year now. My boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently. He has made comments such as “you would look better as a Tumblr girl" or "you should start doing more squats." It's really hurtful.
  - bot: My first thought was that I wondered what changed recently. Is he open to having a discussion about this so you can ask questions such as that one? It's possible that he does not understand the degree to which it hurts you.
- story: What can I do about my boyfriend's verbal abuse?
  steps:
  - user: I try to do everything right just so we won't argue, and it doesn't help the only time he is calm is when he is drinking alcohol. I get anxiety over having fights with him.

- story: What can I do about my partner's parents not liking me?
  steps:
  - user: I’m in my early 20s. My ex’s parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me. I left my ex due to an abusive situation, and they are making me look like I was the bad one.
  - bot: Maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future. If you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex, that could be one element of the discussion, but it doesn't have to be.
- story: How do I get over jealousy?
  steps:
  - user: I’m in a relationship with my child's father. I’m a really jealous person. We don’t go out or do anything with other people because of me. To keep our relationship going, I know I have to stop being jealous, but I can’t. How can I get over these issues?

- story: How can I stop thinking so negatively about myself?
  steps:
  - user: I'm depressed and recently went through a break up. It’s like every guy I like only wants me for sex. I think I'm ugly, and sometimes I just want to die. I have a son, and I got really big when I was pregnant. I have stretch marks on my stomach.
  - bot: If you are currently feeling as if you want to die, please call 800-273-8255 and talk to someone. One way to work on not always thinking so negatively about yourself is to surround yourself with people who are more positive toward you. Do you have friends or family who are supportive?
- story: My husband only has sex with me once a month or less.
  steps:
  - user: I'm feeling rejected and frustrated. This is not new. The first month we were together, sex was about every day. Then it slowed down to once a month right away. I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.
  - bot: Have you said anything to your husband about the way you're feeling? Start with this. Sex is after all, a two person enterprise. If he would like to talk about the way you're feeling, great and wonderful. The two of you already are continuing to grow trust in your communication and relationship.
- story: How do I tell my parents that I think I have some mental problems?
  steps:
  - user: I am pretty sure I have depression and anxiety. I also have voices in my head. I have problems sleeping too. I've already been diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. I have self-harmed in the last and used to be suicidal. How do I tell them this and ask for therapy?
  - bot: What stops you now from telling your parents the way you are feeling? Do you imagine asking them for therapy would be a surprise for them? If they're paying attention to you at all, then I imagine they'd feel relief to know you're aware of having some feelings within yourself of a problem.
- story: What does it mean that I feel like different genders?
  steps:
  - user: I was born a girl. I look like a boy. I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. I don't know what to say if someone asks my gender. I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.

- story: Should I be upset that my husband may have lied to me again?
  steps:
  - user: I’m trying to make marriage work after a split. Before our split, he lied a lot and broke every promise to me. I don't think he cheated. Last month, I asked what women work with him, so he told me. Yesterday, I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about. Should I be upset?
  - bot: Are you upset, is the more pertinent question. Everyone has their own tolerance for lies and their unique reasons for being married. Trust your own answers to the question you ask here.
- story: How do you overcome an embarrassing mistake and forgive yourself?
  steps:
  - user: I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.

- story: I'm struggeling with the idea of if God real or not?
  steps:
  - user: Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?
  - bot: Believing in God is a matter of faith. There are many opinions out there for and against God’s existence. But the real question is not if God is real or not, but, do you want to have faith and decide that he exists? This is a personal choice.
- story: My husband only has sex with me once a month or less.

  - bot: I agree with Sherry, it is OK to give the answer that you feel most familiar with. The most important part is not who people think you are, but that you know who you are. Read about gender identity and fluidity. Discovering the answer is a process, don't rush it to comply with others either way.

  steps:
  - user: I am pretty sure I have depression and anxiety. I also have voices in my head. I have problems sleeping too. I've already been diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. I have self-harmed in the last and used to be suicidal. How do I tell them this and ask for therapy?

- story: How can I talk to my psychologist about upping my dose of Xanax?
  steps:
  - user: I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them.
  - bot: Do you think you're abusing xanax? It is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicted. Drugs don't do anything helpful in solving life's problems.
- story: What can I do about my depression and anxiety after trying so many things?
  steps:
  - user: I have terrible anxiety and depression. I've tried various therapists and pills, but nothing's helped.
  - bot: Is it possible you simply didn't mix well with the particular therapists with whom you've worked? If this is possible, interview a therapist before starting therapy. Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life.
- story: How can I convince my mother I have anxiety and panic attacks?
  steps:
  - user: I've been dealing with this for years. My mom thinks I'm overly emotional and refuses to offer any help, like therapy or seeing a doctor. She's seen me when I'm having a panic attack and just said I was faking for attention or that I'm a hypochondriac. I just want to get better.
  - bot: How old are you? Are you old enough in your State to have therapy without your mother's consent? Your mom's attitude toward you may be one significant reason on why you feels so much tension in the first place. Don't let her opinions and beliefs get in the way of what you know about yourself.
- story: Why do some people try to make a joke for everything and laugh at everything?
  steps:
  - user: These "jokes" are made about everything. They seem to have the need to say something "funny" about everything. It's not funny, just awkward.
  - bot: I agree, it is awkward when people make jokes about subjects which may not be funny at all. And, if a person only jokes, then after laughing and realizing the person has nothing of themselves to offer, this can also be quite tedious.
- story: Why do I feel like I will never have a good career/amount to anything financially?
  steps:
  - user: I'm in my early 20s. I've worked since two months after I turned 18. I have “plans.” I could become an electrician, or I could operate heavy machinery. I have goals, but I do nothing to try to meet them because I don't feel I can. I just want a better life for my fiancée and the kids than I did.
  - bot: For starters, commend yourself for being committed to working. You have no idea what is going to happen in the next second, so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story.
- story: What should I do about my husband's emotional affair with his ex-wife?
  steps:
  - user: My husband had an emotional affair with his ex-wife in November. She invited him to dinner, alone, with their daughter. I wasn’t aware of this until after 11pm when I asked where he was. He had been drinking, and I told him not to come home that night.
  - bot: My answer is going to be super simplistic but I believe this may be what you need. Ask your husband if he wants to stay married to you. If he says yes, then it would be helpful to go to a marriage counselor and work this out with a professional. If he says no, then you can file for divorce.
- story: A friend of my child's father is sending him inappropriate content
  steps:
  - user: I believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content. The father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs. His co-worker sent him an inappropriate video. He got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that.
  - bot: In my book, this is a boundary issue. Although you do not like inappropriate content, it is not up to you what your child's father looks at or what his friend sends him. It is really hard not to monitor other people's lives, but in the end, your rights begin and end with you.
- story: I'm soon to be married, and I've been messing around with others.
  steps:
  - user: I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.
  - bot: Divorce is expensive emotionally and financially. If your fiance is not ok with an open marriage, it would be a good idea to seek the help of a counselor before you get married.
- story: My toddler wants her daddy to die when she's mad at him
  steps:
  - user: I told her that if daddy dies, we will never see him again. She started crying because I wouldn't make her daddy die.
  - bot: It's normal for a child to be so angry she wanted someone to die, but this seems to be heading into a dangerous realm. I think it would be wise to have her seen by a child psychologist just to rule out anything more serious.
- story: Do I have some type of anxiety?
  steps:
  - user: Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth.
  - bot: Though I don't know for sure, it sounds like anxiety to me. I think it would be helpful if you work with a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders.
- story: What can I do about my depression and anxiety after trying so many things?
  steps:
  - user: I have terrible anxiety and depression. I've tried various therapists and pills, but nothing's helped.
  - bot: I'm sorry that you have tried several different things and not had much relief. I will say that there are several different types of medications that may help and each therapist is different, so it is quite possible that a different combination of things you've already tried may be helpful.
- story: How can I convince my mother I have anxiety and panic attacks?
  steps:
  - user: I've been dealing with this for years. My mom thinks I'm overly emotional and refuses to offer any help, like therapy or seeing a doctor. She's seen me when I'm having a panic attack and just said I was faking for attention or that I'm a hypochondriac. I just want to get better.
  - bot: I don't know how old you are, but in Pennsylvania, if you are over 14, you can have therapy without your parents' consent. If you are young enough to use their insurance, that could be complicated, but depending on the state, there may be ways to work around that as well.
- story: Do I have some type of anxiety?
  steps:
  - user: Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth.

- story: My ex-boyfriend say we're finished but still acts like we aren't
  steps:
  - user: I've been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but it's hurting so much.
  - bot: This can be difficult and confusing. If you think your boyfriend would be open to having a discussion, try asking him for a time when he is willing to have an important discussion.
- story: What is a psychotic seizure?
  steps:
  - user: My doctor seems to think I am in danger of having one. I neglected to ask how this was different than an episode. I have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type 1.
  - bot: I will admit that I'm not specifically familiar with this from my own experience.
- story: My ex-boyfriend say we're finished but still acts like we aren't
  steps:
  - user: I've been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but it's hurting so much.
  - bot: Have you brought up the topic as to the way you're feeling? The best way for someone to understand us or to understand someone, is to directly talk about the specific problem. To start the discussion w your partner, understand your own reasons for continuing the relationship.
- story: How do I know if I am obsessed or in love with someone?
  steps:
  - user: We had great chemistry, but then he became distant. I had the feeling that I can't be without him. As soon as I felt the difference, I was scared to lose him. I started freaking out if he did not answer, thinking that something bad happened.
  - bot: The simplest answer is that love feels good, obsessions don't. Love deepens a sense of peacefulness and security. Obsessions give anxiety and worry of feeling abandoned. One suggestion is to study more about yourself and why you'd feel so ill at ease when you aren't w this person.
- story: How do I know if I am obsessed or in love with someone?
  steps:
  - user: We had great chemistry, but then he became distant. I had the feeling that I can't be without him. As soon as I felt the difference, I was scared to lose him. I started freaking out if he did not answer, thinking that something bad happened.
  - bot: People often care deeply for those whom they love. I don't know how long you have been together. It is also common to want to be very closely connected to people who are important to you.
- story: How can I be less stressed out?
  steps:
  - user: I shake and have panic attacks.
  - bot: One of the first things I would suggest is to see if you can keep track of what is leading you to feel anxious. If you shake all the time, consider talking with your primary care physician. Sometimes that can be a hormonal imbalance or another chemical imbalance (such as thyroid).
- story: How can I find myself again?
  steps:
  - user: I just don't know what I want in life anymore. I'm can't figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused. I can't put things into perspective at all. I'm just stuck, and I'm disappointed with my lack of accomplishments.
  - bot: It sounds as if you would benefit from talking with a local mental health professionals so you can discuss some details. Having said that, I wonder if you could consider how you would define yourself to someone who doesn't know you.
- story: Why do I feel like I don't belong anywhere?
  steps:
  - user: There are many people willing to lovingly provide me with a home. I have food, clothes, and a university education, but I never feel like I belong. Even when I have a good time with people who are supposed to be close, I feel like I'm just out with friends and I never go home.
  - bot: For some people, having a sense of belonging takes some time. You mentioned that you have an education and some basic daily needs. I wonder if you may be able to look at your relationship with yourself and what makes you feel happy, safe, and having a sense of accomplishment.
- story: Why do I feel like I'm nothing more than a wife and mom?
  steps:
  - user: I'm in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like I've lost my identity, and I don't know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know I'd feel like worse without them.
  - bot: It sound like there are some parts of your life that you really enjoy it and also some things that you wish were different. You say you feel like nothing more than a wife and mom, so I wonder if you could make a list of what else you are (friend, daughter, etc.).
- story: Is it normal to take a parent role and feel so hurt and broken as a teenager?
  steps:
  - user: I'm a teenager. My dad has been jail for the last five years. It's tough, but my mom really tries to give a normal life to my two sisters, my brother, and I. I feel like I took upon a parent role when I'm the second youngest, and I'm not stable. My mother and sisters say I'm overdramatic.
  - bot: It sounds like you have a lot of weight on your shoulders. I'm not sure what you mean when you say you're not stable and you are breaking down. If you are crying because you're sad, that is okay.
- story: What can I do about my boyfriend being so close with another girl?
  steps:
  - user: My boyfriend has this close female friend. It always bothered me because of how close they are, so I decided to meet her. That made the situation worse because they were even closer than what I thought. They acted like a couple rather than friends with each other.
  - bot: I wonder if you could have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you are feeling.
- story: Why can't my mom ever be proud of me?
  steps:
  - user: She constantly tells me what I am doing wrong. For once, I want her to be proud of me. It’s like no matter what I do, she does not have one nice word to say to me. She is always hateful towards me and always has been.
  - bot: I imagine this is very difficult and confusing for you. It sounds like there are things for which you are proud of yourself, which is really good. I hope there are also other people in your life that are currently able to recognize the good things that you're doing.
- story: Did I make a mistake breaking up with a guy who said his ex-girlfriend will always be on his mind?
  steps:
  - user: He was in love with someone years ago, and he still thinks about her time to time. He said, and I quote, "That relationship is definitely over. I love you, but that girl will always be in my mind." It just didn't feel like he appreciated all the things I've done to make him happy.
  - bot: It sounds like you were in a tough spot here. I'm not able to tell you whether or not you made a mistake because the decision is yours. I am wondering what led you to ask whether you made a mistake and whether you wish you were still in the relationship with this guy.
- story: Do I have some type of anxiety?
  steps:
  - user: Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth.
  - bot: 'Yes, it seems like you may have a type of anxiety: but considering that it is intermittent, it may be a good idea to talk to a therapist and explore what triggers the anxiety. Different types of anxiety are caused by different scenarios, memories, or stressors.'
- story: My husband only has sex with me once a month or less.
  steps:
  - user: I'm feeling rejected and frustrated. This is not new. The first month we were together, sex was about every day. Then it slowed down to once a month right away. I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.
  - bot: Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband. I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage.
- story: How do I deal with a lack of intimacy and partner's addiction to solo sex and porn?
  steps:
  - user: I believe my partner has a masturbation and porn problem. He masturbates daily, even when I am lying in bed sleeping beside him. We have sex once a week. He is rough and worries about his needs. He never touches me, and treats me like a porn star, wanting to finish on my face or chest.
  - bot: The comments here from the other therapists are "spot on". As a Certified Sex Addiction Therapist-Candidate I'm convinced your partner's acting out creates trauma for you. Your partner's addiction is NOT your fault and his recovery IS his responsibility.
- story: I'm soon to be married, and I've been messing around with others.
  steps:
  - user: I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.
  - bot: It took a lot of courage to share what must be so shameful to you and to ask for help.
- story: Should my step-daughters be told that their step-father has a child pornography addiction?
  steps:
  - user: My husband’s ex-wife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor. He, by his own admission, is addicted to child pornography. My step-daughters are now all teenagers. They do not know. My husband’s ex-wife has kept this information from my step-daughters.
  - bot: The information from the other therapists here is sound and prudent. There are what sounds to be real legal (is this man a RSO [registered sex offender]; is he prohibited from being in proximity to minors?
- story: My apartment manager won't let me keep an emotional support dog.
  steps:
  - user: I have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor. They wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog, I have the paper work, and I gave it to my apartment manager. They said I can't keep the ESD because I'm not disabled. What do you suggest I do?
  - bot: This can be a difficult situation. Typically, only animals that are specifically trains to accomplish a specific task are legally protected as Service Animsls. Even though that can be very helpful, emotional support animals are not generally protected in the same way.
- story: My ex-boyfriend say we're finished but still acts like we aren't
  steps:
  - user: I've been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but it's hurting so much.
  - bot: That does sound very confusing...and hurtful. You do not have to tolerate someone treating you in a way that hurts you. It may be helpful to decide where the boundaries are for you and to stay true to them in your interactions with him. You teach other people how they are allowed to treat you.
- story: I'm soon to be married, and I've been messing around with others.
  steps:
  - user: I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.
  - bot: I would start by examining the reasons for seeking out other relationships. Are you getting something from the other men that you do not currently receive from your current partner? Such as, is it more exciting with others and that excitement is lacking in your current relationship?
- story: Do I have some type of anxiety?
  steps:
  - user: Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth.
  - bot: I would suggest keeping a log of those days when you are having a hard time. Items to write would be what were you doing before you felt this way, did you eat and what, what time of day is it, how much sleep did you get that night, etc... This can help you identify any triggers.
- story: How can I help my son succeed in life when he refuses it?
  steps:
  - user: When my son was a teenager, we sent him to live with his dad because of the constant disrespectful attitude. A week after he graduated, his dad made him leave because of the same issues. All four parents tried to talk to him, and he just refuses help all around. He is now living with his grandparents.
  - bot: I admire your efforts. You can continue to offer assistance for your son, but it is ultimately up to him to decide what to do with the information or ideas that you are giving to him. One thing you might try is to ask questions in a way that enables you to learn more about what he is experiencing.
- story: I'm starting to believe that I'm gay
  steps:
  - user: In middle school and high school, my friends and family thought I was gay. I tried telling them, but they wouldn’t believe me. It almost feels like they wanted me to be. Now I’m actually starting to believe them. I know I wasn’t back then, and now I’m not sure anymore.
  - bot: I agree with Amy. We get a lot of pressure from others and even ourselves to define who we are and what we want at a pretty early age. The truth is, our sexuality can change and grow in directions we never imagined. I may be wrong, but I am getting the impression that you may not want to be gay.
- story: I have nightmares and flashbacks about a past relationship
  steps:
  - user: I was the one who ended it, and I'm so glad I did. It was the best decision I made in my life. But how do I stop the nightmares and flashbacks? It is creating a wall in my current relationship.
  - bot: One thing you could try to do on your own is to focus on the partner who is in front of you now. If you are able to connect with them via touch or focusing on their tone of voice, that may help to center you. Tried to stay grounded and/or mindful.
- story: How can I atone for being cowardly?
  steps:
  - user: I panicked over a minor parking lot mistake. It was totally my fault, but due to another insurance issue, I left a note with an illegible phone number. Guilty over this, I got an envelope containing several hundred dollars.
  - bot: Thanks for sharing as it shows your humanity and that you have a sensitive conscience. In your example here I'd encourage you to always think, "safety first"; and never offer a stranger at the accident scene "...several hundred dollars". Why? Because it could go badly against you (i.e.
- story: How do I find myself?
  steps:
  - user: I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
  - bot: This is perhaps the deepest question that one can ask of themselves and the answer is as elusive as the deepest enigma.
- story: I completely lost myself—how can I find myself again?
  steps:
  - user: I've become so jaded that I can't control my thoughts. I cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks.
  - bot: I imagine that it's pretty disconcerting to feel as though you lost yourself. When you said that you are jaded, I'm not sure whether you mean that you are jaded toward someone, something, life in general, or some combination thereof.
- story: How can I have a better sex life when I don't like sex?
  steps:
  - user: My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing.
  - bot: There are a lot of different things that could be playing a role here. First, different people have unique levels of sex drive, and sometimes there is a hormonal imbalance.
- story: My apartment manager won't let me keep an emotional support dog.
  steps:
  - user: I have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor. They wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog, I have the paper work, and I gave it to my apartment manager. They said I can't keep the ESD because I'm not disabled. What do you suggest I do?
  - bot: This is tricky because there are different types of emotional support dogs. The ones that are officially trained actually go through months of training and then are paired with someone for whom they perform specific tasks.
- story: How do I find myself?
  steps:
  - user: I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
  - bot: Because you put this under the category of spirituality, I'm not sure whether you are asking how you find yourself as far as religious or spiritual beliefs or overall.
- story: How can I avoid family members who stress me out?
  steps:
  - user: My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. She calls me every day complaining, but I don't want to hear it anymore.
  - bot: This sounds stressful. You mentioned that you want to learn how to avoid them. I'm not sure whether you want to avoid them overall or if you would like to ask your mom to maybe only talk to you about it for a few minutes about your niece in each conversation that you have.
- story: Why is my fiancé angry at me about his automobile insurance?
  steps:
  - user: My fiancé and I recently had an argument over finances. He gives me the money each month to pay his automobile insurance. He no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy.
  - bot: A few things come to mind. I wonder if your fiancé is still angry about it or if he was angry in that moment and has now worked through it. It sounds like there was also a difference in expectations here.
- story: How can I get my ex-girlfriend back?
  steps:
  - user: She said she needed space after three days of dating, and she got a boyfriend a week later. I still really miss her, and she told me she still likes me.
  - bot: It sounds as if your ex-girlfriend is trying to figure out what type of relationship she is looking to have with you.
- story: Why did my sister not defend me when my ex-husband said bad things about me?
  steps:
  - user: I recently went through a divorce. My ex-husband called my sister saying bad things about me. My sister never defended me. Now that I showed the truth, she's shutting me up and saying she doesn't care about the fight. Why didn't she convey that to him from the beginning?
  - bot: Unfortunately, I can't tell you what your sister was feeling or why she reacted that way. I can say that divorces can be difficult or confusing for everyone involved. While the divorce is most impactful for the couple going through it, the divorce itself also changes extended family dynamics.
- story: Do I text, call, or make contact first, the same day of the morning I left his house?
  steps:
  - user: I've known him for about six years. We've dated off and on. I hadn't seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again. I really want this to last this time. I stayed the night. Do I text, call, or make contact first, the same day of the morning I left his house?
  - bot: I don't see why you can't call, text, or make contact first. It would be up to him to reply when he can and wants to, but I don't know why you couldn't initiate contact. One thing to consider as you get to know each other better is having conversations about conversations.
- story: Is there anything I can do to make my anxiety go away?
  steps:
  - user: I'm a teenager, and while I’ve never been to any kind of therapist, I noticed I experience several anxiety symptoms. I frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house.
  - bot: With the way you described your anxiety, it sounds like you have different types of anxiety. I'm not sure whether you have anxiety of public places, large crowds, being alone (sometimes called separation anxiety), or some combination thereof.
- story: How can I deal with a break up?
  steps:
  - user: My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.
  - bot: There is a grieving process after losing a relationship (or any other major loss, such as a job, a house, etc.).
- story: Why does my spouse tell me he doesn't want me, but also gets jealous of me?
  steps:
  - user: My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago. Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house. He says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce.
  - bot: It sounds like this is quite difficult. It sounds as if sometimes your spouse want you to be a part of his life (which could be a part of where the jealousy comes from) and sometimes he doesn't.
- story: How do I get my partner to stop verbally abusing me?
  steps:
  - user: Every time my partner gets angry for anything, she takes it out on me. Nothing I do is right, and once she's mad, she calls me all kinds of names and is verbally abusive. She says it isn’t abuse, it’s just angry verbal bashing, and that it’s different. It gets worse each time.
  - bot: 'One thing you could try is to talk to your partner when she''s not angry about the following: If she''s angry, maybe she can talk with you about what she is angry about rather than calling you names.'
- story: How do I handle being wanted in a relationship when I'm used to feeling unwanted?
  steps:
  - user: I've always thought that there wasn't much good out there for me. Now that things are actually going well, it kind of scares me. I spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured I would be alone. I recently met a great woman who seems to really like me, and I don't know how to process this.
  - bot: This can be really anxiety-producing when you have not felt it before. It may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideas.
- story: How do I make my relationship with my girlfriend better?
  steps:
  - user: She's busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family. We don't talk much because of it. Also, we have little fights. We want to work it out but we don't know how.
  - bot: Maybe you can start with having 15 minutes per week that you know you will be spending time with each other (even if it needs to be on the phone). Because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time, at least you would know there was that time that was set aside.
- story: My friend had lied about every aspect of her life—what do I do?
  steps:
  - user: She has lied about every aspect of her life. She's created three fake relationships. The most recent one is concerning because she has fake photos, phone calls, and text messages, and it’s with a married man with kids. Her lying is becoming dangerous because she could ruin lives.
  - bot: To be honest, I think more information would be really important here because what you are asking could have a lot of different meanings. Consider making an appointment with a local therapist to discuss what you are going through.
- story: How do I break an unhealthy relationship pattern?
  steps:
  - user: I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it. I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling.
  - bot: 'Here are some things I''m wondering: Do you have close friends that you can talk to, trust, and who can be around sometimes when you''re in between relationships? What do you like about yourself? What are your strongest points?'

  steps:
  - user: I'm a teenager, and I know the importance of my upcoming schooling. However, no matter how much I put in my best effort, my family thinks I have done zero effort in total. What can I do?
  - bot: First of all, I'm glad that you posted here and I'm glad that you recognize the importance of schooling. Where does your family get the idea that you are not putting in the effort?
- story: Should I be upset that my husband may have lied to me again?
  steps:
  - user: I’m trying to make marriage work after a split. Before our split, he lied a lot and broke every promise to me. I don't think he cheated. Last month, I asked what women work with him, so he told me. Yesterday, I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about. Should I be upset?
  - bot: Imagine your best friend just told you that her husband lied to her all the time and that he had broken every promise he ever made to her. What would you tell her? If I were her best friend I'd tell her to run the other way. You may love this man. We don't choose who we love.
- story: How do I find myself?
  steps:
  - user: I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
  - bot: The older I get, the more I believe that our real task isn't to 'find' ourselves. We're already 100% "there." What we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive, most happy, most creative, and most fully engaged with life.
- story: How do I repair my friendship?
  steps:
  - user: My best friend and I were pranking her friend, and I told her to tell him that she likes him. She said no, but I forced her. After she told him, he told her that he likes her too. Their friendship is ruined because of me. She won't forgive me, and I feel really guilty. I feel like crying.
  - bot: This takes time. I don't know how long it has been, but perhaps if your friend is willing to discuss other things with you for a little while, you could discuss this at some point in the future. Hopefully the true intentions will become apparent (in the idea that it was a prank).
- story: Should I talk honestly to my brother about his girlfriend, risking our own relationship?
  steps:
  - user: My older brother (in his 60s) started dating a lady with Asperger's. She is hyper-sexual and flirty. She does not understand boundaries. They’ve been dating for a few months, and she's talking marriage. Another sibling and his wife have met her, and they have said she is never invited back.
  - bot: This is tricky and quite delicate. I wonder if you could talk with your brother about whether he would be willing to have a discussion with you about something that is important to you. I would also suggest trying to make clear your true intentions.
- story: Why am I sick to my stomach when I stand up?
  steps:
  - user: I had to put a restraining order against my ex-fiancé. He was served last night. He was mentally and verbally abusive towards me. I thought it was my nerves, but every time I stand up, I get sick. If I sit and rock, I'm fine.
  - bot: Hello, and thank you for your question. You may be right, your physical symptoms of getting sick to your stomach may very well be your nerves or anxiety. That is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances. Another thing that is not unusual is that you feel better when you sit and rock.
- story: Should I be upset that my husband may have lied to me again?
  steps:
  - user: I’m trying to make marriage work after a split. Before our split, he lied a lot and broke every promise to me. I don't think he cheated. Last month, I asked what women work with him, so he told me. Yesterday, I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about. Should I be upset?
  - bot: I would ask you first what made you give him another chance after he repeatedly lied and broke every promise to you? I would imagine if he repeatedly lied to you that it will damage your ability to trust him now. Is he in therapy? Does he recognize that he has a problem and is he trying to repair it?
- story: How can I deal with a break up?
  steps:
  - user: My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.
  - bot: if he as cheated on you multiple times it is not healthy for you to continue seeing him. However It takes time to heal your pain. You are not a robot that can just switch off your emotions. Please surround yourself with people who can support and empower you.
- story: My friend had lied about every aspect of her life—what do I do?
  steps:
  - user: She has lied about every aspect of her life. She's created three fake relationships. The most recent one is concerning because she has fake photos, phone calls, and text messages, and it’s with a married man with kids. Her lying is becoming dangerous because she could ruin lives.
  - bot: Have an honest and open conversation with her about how her behavior is negatively impacting you ( and others). You will feel good knowing you did the right thing.
- story: What can I do when my family doesn't accept my sexuality?
  steps:
  - user: I'm a teenage gay girl, and I'm in love with a girl a few years older than me. She loves me too, but we're not physically together at the moment.
  - bot: They would probably be helpful to speak with a local mental health professional about this, not because there's anything wrong with the real you, but because having these conversations can be difficult and you may choose to talk about your real self in different ways with different people.
- story: The organization I work for has told me I cannot go to my 12 step meetings.
  steps:
  - user: This is my recovery, and I don't feel that it is okay for them to ask this. They told me it is policy due to the fact that I may run into a peer there. I am a peer counselor in the small community that I grew up in. I am in recovery myself.
  - bot: Hello, and thank you for your question. I know that workplaces have some latitude when it comes to requiring certain behaviors from their employees. For example, they may require you to tell them if you get into some kind of legal trouble. But this situation seems completely different.
- story: Should I be upset that my husband may have lied to me again?
  steps:
  - user: I’m trying to make marriage work after a split. Before our split, he lied a lot and broke every promise to me. I don't think he cheated. Last month, I asked what women work with him, so he told me. Yesterday, I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about. Should I be upset?
  - bot: Is really difficult to tell whether he honestly forgot about someone or whether he was really lying again. I don't know whether he would be open to having a discussion with you about your concerns about this and whether you would be actually willing to listen to your thoughts about it.
- story: My toddler wants her daddy to die when she's mad at him
  steps:
  - user: I told her that if daddy dies, we will never see him again. She started crying because I wouldn't make her daddy die.
  - bot: Toddlers don't have the intellectual capacity to conceptualize. Better to find out why she wants daddy to die than explain the future consequences of death to your toddler. A person must be around 9, possibly 8 years old before absorbing the potential effects of an action taken in present time.
- story: How do I find myself?
  steps:
  - user: I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
  - bot: Start by giving yourself enough quiet and time to remember about yourself what feels steady and consistent in your nature and interactions with others. Give yourself the freedom to your interest in having interests.
- story: How can I have a better sex life when I don't like sex?
  steps:
  - user: My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing.
  - bot: The numbers you write are low compared to how much sex many other people would be satisfied having. The key is your and your husband's satisfaction with the amount of sex you are having. And, know if there are reasons besides low sex drive that possibly explain this.
- story: How can I avoid family members who stress me out?
  steps:
  - user: My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. She calls me every day complaining, but I don't want to hear it anymore.

- story: Why is my fiancé angry at me about his automobile insurance?
  steps:
  - user: My fiancé and I recently had an argument over finances. He gives me the money each month to pay his automobile insurance. He no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy.
  - bot: I'd be more worried generally about a fiancee who assumes you are responsible for tracking what in fact are his responsibilities, than about the anger per se.
- story: What should I do about my marriage and my wife's behavior?
  steps:
  - user: My wife and I got separated because I asked about her contact with a male friend of hers. The next day, she kicked me out. She let me move back two days later. Yesterday, she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind.
  - bot: Divorce is a serious, life altering decision. It is best to decide any serious matter through reflection and discussion. Start by knowing what you want from the marriage and why you are willing to move in or out of your own house because your wife tells you to do this.
- story: I crossdress and I don't know how to feel about it.
  steps:
  - user: I am a heterosexual male in my late 20s. I find myself wearing pantyhose, heels, skirts and other women's clothing in private. I am torn on how to feel about it. I enjoy it very much. I have had a pantyhose/stocking fascination and other kinky fetish interests since I was young.
  - bot: Let yourself enjoy crossdressing! What sounds in your way are whatever beliefs you gre up hearing, see and absorb currently. Concentrate on your own satisfaction and that you are doing this in a non-harming way.
- story: What should I do about my marriage and my wife's behavior?
  steps:
  - user: My wife and I got separated because I asked about her contact with a male friend of hers. The next day, she kicked me out. She let me move back two days later. Yesterday, she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind.
  - bot: This has to be very confusing. I wonder if the two of you would be able to have a conversation about what it is that she would like you to know about what happened yesterday and the day before so you know what message she wanted you to get out of all of that.
- story: What should I do after finding my boyfriend flirting on dating websites?
  steps:
  - user: I found the guy I’m dating on dating websites. He was telling women that they were beautiful. He said it wasn’t him and that the phone was hacked. It has since happened two other times. He says he loves me and I’m the only girl he wants to be with, but I feel he is not telling me the truth.
  - bot: I would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create. For example, you may want a relationship where honesty, listening, compassion, and romanticism are major parts. You could also see what your boyfriend wants.
- story: I crossdress and I don't know how to feel about it.
  steps:
  - user: I am a heterosexual male in my late 20s. I find myself wearing pantyhose, heels, skirts and other women's clothing in private. I am torn on how to feel about it. I enjoy it very much. I have had a pantyhose/stocking fascination and other kinky fetish interests since I was young.
  - bot: If you enjoy cross-dressing and are comfortable with how you feelaand aware of your own thoughts and feelings about it in private as compared to in public, I see no problem with that.
- story: How can I get over my fear of public embarrassment?
  steps:
  - user: A lot of times, I avoid situations where I am to meet new people because I have a fear of embarrassing myself. I often avoid large groups of people, like parties, because I think they all constantly judge me.
  - bot: Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue. Everyone, at some point in time, has a fear of public embarrassment.

- story: How do I stop a bully who adults wouldn't recognize as bullying without speaking to the bully?
  steps:
  - user: She mostly targets me on social media. The bullying used to be much worse, but it is still going on. The comments are so vague, but I know that they are meant for me. Even when I confront her, she messages me short phrases to try to get in my head. If I try to fight back, she will ruin me.
  - bot: Sorry to hear of your problem situation. Feeling intimidated by another person is very unsettling. Stop having contact with the person. Bullies only interact with others either by intimidating someone or by themselves feeling intimidated by someone.
- story: I'm not sure if I have social anxiety disorder.

  - user: I feel too scared to meet people I don't know - even relatives. I don't ever raise my hand or talk in school. I feel like no one understands. How can I handle this?
  - bot: It certainly sounds like you have some anxiety. Before deciding whether it was social anxiety or a more general type of anxiety, I would wonder what it is that you think will result from you raising your hand or talking to someone you don't know.
- story: I feel like my relationship is falling apart.
  steps:
  - user: My boyfriend and I have been arguing every night about the same thing. He also tells me that if I go visit my mother out of state he will be gone when I get back. He and my mother do not get along. What should I do?

- story: How do I handle getting the silent treatment from my boyfriend?
  steps:
  - user: 'When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing: no reply, no phone call. If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.'
  - bot: This has to be very difficult to endure. It's pretty common for members of a couple to have different ways of resolving conflict. Very often, one person wants to deal with the conflict right away or shortly thereafter and the other person wants to wait.
- story: Why do I get angry so easily?
  steps:
  - user: Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious. I even start throwing things. Do I have a problem?
  - bot: I don't like the word "problem". It is such a strong word. However I would say that you have an issue that needs to be addressed and controlled before it directed at the wrong person and gets totally out of control. I have found that anger management classes has been helpful for my clients.
- story: Why do I find pleasure in thinking about killing?

- story: My fiancé's ex-husband shows up unannounced.
  steps:

  - user: What do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parent's custody visitation?

  - bot: The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself! If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite. Since you're giving a lot of empathy, maybe you'd like receiving a lot of empathy.

  steps:
  - user: I've been suppressing it for quite some time, but there are days when I can't make eye contact with her. I think she knows, and we both admitted there was some type of vibe, but the overall discussion was vague. I think she could possibly be dating someone that works with us. It's driving me crazy.
  - bot: Human attractions can be tricky things, and in this case - a power dynamic. In the workplace, a boss usually has the power to hire, fire, set schedules, approve vacations, and evaluate performance.
- story: Is screaming and cussing at your child considered emotional abuse?
  steps:
  - user: My dad is always, and I mean always, cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all. He makes me feel stupid. He also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me. Is this abuse?

- story: I did something I can't get over.
  steps:
  - user: I was with my friends fishing by a pond. I found a frog and stabbed it with my friend's knife. I'm not sure why I did it. My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me. Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked. I don't know why I feel like this.

  steps:
  - user: I'm depressed often, and my mind goes a million miles a minute. Every once in a while, things are okay for a few days. After a bit, I start noticing that I am picking at my skin profusely. After roughly a week, the anxiety is back and still picking.
  - bot: Hello, and thank you for your question. I am very sorry that you are struggling. I have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else. Depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions, as you have experienced.
- story: My boyfriend does not do some sexual things with me that he has done with other people.

  - bot: First off, don't blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions. Human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times (e.g., what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time).
- story: Why does my husband like dressing as a female in our bedroom?
  steps:
  - user: He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.
  - bot: 'Depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be "normal" in the bedroom, I can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you! It DOESN''T necessarily mean, however that your husband is: gay, bisexual transgender, or even necessarily a cross-dresser etc.'

  - bot: Hello, and thank you for your question. It really is up to you to decide if you owe him the $25.00. If you feel like it is the right thing to do based on your discussion with him, then pay when you can. I am actually much more concerned with how he is treating you over $25.00.

  steps:
  - user: I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.

- story: Why can't I change?
  steps:
  - user: I know I'm ruining my life with a lot of the decisions I make. I consistently tell myself I need to make some serious changes in my life, but I just can't seem to even though I really want to. Why can't I force myself to change?

- story: I just feel so alone.
  steps:
  - user: I feel so alone. I have so many people around me, but it seems as they just listen and dont understand. They say it will all be okay, or they don't listen to me st all. Everyone says they are here for me but it doesn't feel like they are. Why do I feel so alone?

  - user: I'm dealing with an illness that will never go away and I feel like my life will never change for the better. I feel alone and that i have no one. How can I overcome this pain and learn to be happy alone?
  - bot: Is it possible that even though your illness is chronic, that it goes through phases in which you are more comfortable and that it requires less focus from you than at other times? I think the idea of having a lifelong illness is frustrating and can be depressing to think about.
- story: What happens in a counseling session?
  steps:
  - user: After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?

  steps:
  - user: I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I don't know how. What can I do?

  steps:
  - user: I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out. How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it.
  - bot: While this might not be the first thing you want to discuss when you meet someone, it is important for you to be yourself. It's better to weed out 10 people who can't accept you to find that one who can.
- story: How can I help my fiancé accept and let go of my past?
  steps:
  - user: My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the "straight and narrow" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others. His insecurities are hurting our relationship.
  - bot: You are right that his insecurities are at the root of the issue. You cannot change that for him. He will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own. What you can do is reassure him in whatever ways possible, but always recognizing that you can't "fix" this for him.

  steps:
  - user: I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?
